KOEPPEL TO RESCHEDULE THE CASE UNTIL\nMAY 15, 2008\n\nSECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG\n\nMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\nMr. Hoffman addressed a question to Sgt. Krauel or Lead Code Enforcement\nOfficer Walton as to whether people were starting to pay more attention to Code\nEnforcement or perhaps fewer violators were found this month. Mr. Walton said\nthe Town was getting better compliance and perhaps these agendas would be even\nshorter in the future. He said the word was out that not only were the Code\nEnforcement officers looking harder but the Board is not being as generous with\nthe time but still being fair. Mr. Hoffman said he needed to compliment the Town\nCouncil on their efforts to make Code Enforcement an important part of making\nthe community a more habitable place. He said he also wanted to compliment the\nStaff for doing that for the Town.\n\nCaptain Blouin said when Code Enforcement was first transferred to the Police\nDepartment, things were structured a little differently. In the past, it had been\ntreated more leniently. The citizens did not take it seriously because they believed\nthey were\n\ngoing to keep getting more time. He said some of the earlier cases when the Police\nDepartment took over were more than a year old when they came before the\nBoard. The police department changed it so the cases are before the Board more\nquickly. Many of the attorneys who were known to defend the code violation type\nof cases initially were very combative. That attitude has now changed and they are\ncontacting the Police Department to see what they need to do to come into\ncompliance. Captain Blouin said he wanted to thank the Board for their efforts in\nmaking this happen within the community because it is making code enforcement\nmore efficient in the Town.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016610\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 04/17/08\n\nC.

He said\nthere had been no response from Mr. Gilbertson with the exception of a letter\nwhich was received today and was included in the packet of case information given\nto the Board members.

Mr. Gerry said Mr. Gilbertson\ncould obtain zoning approval and building permits for the brick pavers but it would\nhave to be related to residentially permitted uses allowed for that particular\nproperty.

Beyond the stable at Howard Wise, there were the \u00e9migr\u00e9s forming the collective\nGRAV in Paris, the \u201ccybernetic architectures\u201d of Nicolas Schoffer, the light and plastic\ngyrations of the German Zero Gruppe, and so on\u2014all defining and informing the genre\nof installation art to come.\n\nThe artistic use of cybernetic beings in the late sixties made no investment in\n\u201cintelligence.\u201d Knowing machines were dumb and incapable of emotion, these creators\nwere confident in staging frank simulations. What interested them were machinic\nmotions evoking drives, instincts, and affects; they mimicked sexual and animal\nbehaviors, as if below the threshold of consciousness. Such artists were uninterested in\nthe manipulation of data or information (although Hans Haacke would move in that\ndirection by 1972 with his \u201cReal-Time Systems\u201d works). The cybernetic culture that\nartists and scientists were putting in place on two continents embedded the human in the\ntechnosphere and seduced perception with the graceful and responsive behaviors of the\nmachinic phylum. \u201cArtificial\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d intertwined in this early cybernetic\naesthetic.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t end here. Crucial to the expansion of this uncritical, largely\nmasculine set of cybernetic environments would be a radical, critical cohort of\nastonishing women artists emerging in the 1990s, fully aware of their predecessors in art\nand technology but perhaps more inspired by the feminist founders of the 1970 journal\nRadical Software and the cultural blast of Donna Haraway\u2019s inspiring 1984 polemic, \u201cA\nCyborg Manifesto.\u201d The creaky gender theater of Paik and Pask, the innocent creatures\nof Ihnatowicz and Tsai, were mobilized as savvy, performative, and postmodern, as in\nLynn Hershman Leeson\u2019s Dollie Clone Series (1995-98) consisting of the interactive\nassemblages Cyberkoberta and Tillie, the Telerobotic Doll, who worked the\ntechnosphere with the professionalism of burlesque, winking and folding us viewers into\nan explicit consciousness of our voyeuristic position as both seeing subjects and objects-\nto-be-looked-at.\n\nThe \u201cinnocent\u201d technosphere established by male cybernetic sculptors of the\n1960s was, by the 1990s, identified by feminist artists as an entirely suffusive condition\ndemanding our critical attention. At the same time, feminists tackled the question of\nwhose \u201cintelligence\u201d AI was attempting to simulate. For an artist such as Hershman\nLeeson, responding to the technical \u201ctriumph\u201d of cloning Dolly the sheep, it was crucial\nto draw the connection between meat production and \u201cmeat machines.\u201d Hershman\nLeeson produced \u201cdolls\u201d as clones, offering a critical framing of the way contemporary\nindividuation had become part of an ideological, replicative, plastic realm.\n\nWhile the technofeminists of the 1990s and into the 2000s weren\u2019t all cyber all\nthe time, their works nonetheless complicated the dominant machinic and kinetic\nqualities of male artists\u2019 previous techno-environments.

But does that mean that it was built for the purpose?\nThe ball rolls down the hill because of gravitational pull. Or the ball rolls down the hill\nbecause it\u2019s satisfying the principle of least action. There are typically these two\nexplanations for some action that seems purposeful: the mechanistic explanation and the\nteleological. Essentially all of our existing technology fails the test of being minimal in\nachieving its purpose. Most of what we build is steeped in technological history, and it\u2019s\nincredibly non-minimal for achieving its purpose. Look at a CPU chip; there\u2019s no way\nthat that\u2019s the minimal way to achieve what a CPU chip achieves.\n\nThis question of how to identify purposefulness is a hard one. It\u2019s an important\nquestion, because radio noise from the galaxy is very similar to CDMA transmissions\nfrom cell phones. Those transmissions use pseudo-noise sequences, which happen to\nhave certain repeatability properties. But they come across as noise, and they\u2019re set up as\nnoise, so as not to interfere with other channels. The issue gets messier. If we were to\nobserve a sequence of primes being generated from a pulsar, we\u2019d ask what generated\nthem. Would it mean that a whole civilization grew up and discovered primes and\ninvented computers and radio transmitters and did this? Or is there just some physical\nprocess making primes? There\u2019s a little cellular automaton that makes primes. You can\nsee how it works if you take it apart. It has a little thing bouncing inside it, and out\ncomes a sequence of primes. It didn\u2019t need the whole history of civilization and biology\nand so on to get to that point.\n\nI don\u2019t think there is abstract \u201cpurpose,\u201d per se. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s abstract\nmeaning. Does the universe have a purpose? Then you\u2019re doing theology in some way.\nThere is no meaningful sense in which there is an abstract notion of purpose. Purpose is\nsomething that comes from history.\n\nOne of the things that might be true about our world is that maybe we go through\nall this history and biology and civilization, and at the end of the day the answer is \u201c42,\u201d\nor something. We went through all those 4 billion years of various kinds of evolution\nand then we got to \u201c42.\u201d\n\nNothing like that will happen, because of computational irreducibility. There are\ncomputational processes that you can go through in which there is no way to shortcut that\nprocess. Much of science has been about shortcutting computation done by nature. For\nexample, if we\u2019re doing celestial mechanics and want to predict where the planets will be\na million years from now, we could follow the equations, step-by-step. But the big\nachievement in science is that we\u2019re able to shortcut that and reduce the computation.\nWe can be smarter than the universe and predict the endpoint without going through all\nthe steps. But even with a smart enough machine and smart enough mathematics, we\ncan\u2019t get to the endpoint without going through the steps. Some details are irreducible.\nWe have to irreducibly follow those steps. That\u2019s why history means something. If we\ncould get to the endpoint without going through the steps, history would be, in some\nsense, pointless.\n\nSo it\u2019s not the case that we\u2019re intelligent and everything else in the world is not.\nThere\u2019s no enormous abstract difference between us and the clouds or us and the\ncellular automata.

A permit\nwas obtained but there were some conditions attached to it. There have been two\ninspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an agreement was reached to\nnot require the vegetation to be trimmed until after turtle season. Since they have\nalready been found in non-compliance, the Town recommends the time for\ncompliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if compliance is not achieved by\nthat date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.\n\nJack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and\nadvised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association. He said\none of the documents was his application under duress for the permit. Mr. Maxey\nadvised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by\nRecording Secretary Houston.\n\nMr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the\nDepartment of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level,\nthey do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not\nfind any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit. They told him\nit should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town\nwas cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr.\nMaxey said there were all kinds of burdens in this permit he needed to comply\nwith, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet tall\nwhich was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down. He said he was\nsupposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a\n$10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr.\nMaxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended\nsea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection\nagainst the lighting. Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light\nfixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial\nhealthy vegetation light blocking buffer.\n\nMr. Maxey said an approximate 24 inch piece of aluminum is hanging from the\nlight on Nightingale Trail and it seemed highly unusual that a shield of that nature\nwould only be necessary on that light when the recommendations given by Fish &\nWildlife are recommendations with broad reaching impact for the entire island.

The\nAgreement does not require any planting of trees.\n\n2. ARCOM denied the request by Trump to reconsider its position that trees must be\nplanted.\n\n3.

The difference is a detailed difference.\nThis brainlike neural network was produced by the long history of civilization, whereas\nthe cellular automaton was created by my computer in the last microsecond.\n\nThe problem of abstract AI is similar to the problem of recognizing\nextraterrestrial intelligence: How do you determine whether or not it has a purpose? This\nis a question I don\u2019t consider answered. We\u2019ll say things like, \u201cWell, AI will be\nintelligent when it can do blah-blah-blah. \u201d When it can find primes. When it can\nproduce this and that and the other.

Now we think we\u2019re special because we have intelligence and nothing else\ndoes. I\u2019m afraid the bad news is that that isn\u2019t a distinction.\n\nHere\u2019s one of my scenarios. Let\u2019s say there comes a time when human\nconsciousness is readily uploadable into digital form, virtualized and so on, and pretty\nsoon we have a box of a trillion souls. There are a trillion souls in the box, all virtualized.\nIn the box, there will be molecular computing going on\u2014maybe derived from biology,\nmaybe not. But the box will be doing all kinds of elaborate stuff. And there\u2019s a rock\nsitting next to the box. Inside a rock, there are always all kinds of elaborate stuff going\non, all kinds of subatomic particles doing all kinds of things. What\u2019s the difference\nbetween the rock and the box of a trillion souls? The answer is that the details of what\u2019s\nhappening in the box were derived from the long history of human civilization, including\nwhatever people watched on YouTube the day before. Whereas the rock has its long\ngeological history but not the particular history of our civilization.\n\nRealizing that there isn\u2019t a genuine distinction between intelligence and mere\ncomputation leads you to imagine that future\u2014the endpoint of our civilization as a box of\ntrillion souls, each of them essentially playing a video game, forever.

Dead Imagine, through its\nlarge-scale and cubic \u201cPlatonic\u201d form, remains both artificial and locked into the body\u2014\nrefusing a detached \u201cintelligence\u201d as being no intelligence at all.\n\nArtists in the new millennium inherit this critical tradition and inhabit the current\nparadigms of AI, which has slid from partial simulations to claims of intelligence. In the\n1955 proposal thought to be the first printed usage of the phrase \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d\ncomputer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel\nRochester, and Claude Shannon conjectured that \u201cevery aspect of learning or any other\nfeature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be\nmade to simulate it.\u201d This modest theoretical goal has inflated over the past sixty-four\nyears and is now expressed by Google DeepMind as an ambition to \u201cSolve intelligence.\u201d\nCrack the code! But unfortunately, what we hear cracking is not code but small-scale\ncapitalism, the social contract, and the scaffolding of civility. Taking away the jobs of\ntaxi and truck drivers, roboticizing direct marketing, hegemonizing entertainment,\nprivatizing utilities, and depersonalizing health care\u2014are these the \u201cwhips\u201d that Wiener\nfeared we would learn to love?\n\nArtists can\u2019t solve any of this. But they can remind us of the creative potential of\nthe paths not taken\u2014the forks in the road that were emerging around 1970, before\n\u201cinformation\u201d became capital and \u201cintelligence\u201d equaled data harvesting. Richly\nevocative of what can be done with contemporary tools when revisiting earlier\npossibilities is French artist Philippe Parreno\u2019s \u201cfirefly piece,\u201d so nicknamed to avoid\nhaving to iterate its actual title: With a Rhythmic Instinction to Be Able to Travel Beyond\nExisting Forces of Life (2014). Described by the artist as \u201can automaton,\u201d the sculptural\ninstallation juxtaposes a flickering projection of black-and-white drawings of fireflies\nwith a band of oscillating green-on-black binary figures. The drawings and binary\nfigures are animated using algorithms from mathematician John Horton Conway\u2019s 1970\nGame of Life, a \u201ccellular automaton.\u201d\n\nConway set up parameters for any square (\u201ccell\u201d) to be lit (\u201calive\u201d) or dark\n(\u201cdead\u201d) in an infinite, two-dimensional grid. The rules are summarized as follows: A\nsingle cell will quickly die of loneliness. But a cell touching three or more other \u201clive\u201d\ncells will also die, \u201cdue to crowding.\u201d A cell survives and thrives if it has just two\nneighbors... and soon. As one cell dies, it may create the conditions for other cells to\nsurvive, yielding patterns that appear to move and grow, shifting across the grid like\nevanescent neural impulses or bioluminescent clusters of diatoms. In Stephen Hawking\u2019s\n2012 film The Meaning of Life, the narrator describes Conway\u2019s mathematical model as\nsimulating \u201chow a complex thing like the mind might come about from a basic set of\nrules,\u201d revealing the overweening ambitions that characterize contemporary AI: \u201c[T]hese\ncomplex properties emerge from simple laws that contain no concepts like movement or\nreproduction,\u201d yet they produce \u201cspecies,\u201d and cells \u201ccan even reproduce, just as life does\nin the real world.\u201d \u00b0\u00b0\n\nJust as life does?

We restricted n to\n5, and limited our study to n-grams occurring at least 40 times\nin the corpus.\n\nUsage frequency is computed by dividing the number of\ninstances of the n-gram in a given year by the total number of\nwords in the corpus in that year. For instance, in 1861, the 1-\ngram \u201cslavery\u201d appeared in the corpus 21,460 times, on\n11,687 pages of 1,208 books. The corpus contains\n386,434,758 words from 1861; thus the frequency is 5.5x10\u00b0.\n\u201cslavery\u201d peaked during the civil war (early 1860s) and then\nagain during the civil rights movement (1955-1968) (Fig. 1B)\n\nIn contrast, we compare the frequency of \u201cthe Great War\u201d\nto the frequencies of \u201cWorld War I\u201d and \u201cWorld War II.\u201d \u201cthe\nGreat War\u201d peaks between 1915 and 1941. But although its\nfrequency drops thereafter, interest in the underlying events\nhad not disappeared; instead, they are referred to as \u201cWorld\nWar I\u201d (Fig. 1C).\n\nThese examples highlight two central factors that\ncontribute to culturomic trends. Cultural change guides the\nconcepts we discuss (such as \u201cslavery\u201d). Linguistic change \u2014\nwhich, of course, has cultural roots \u2014 affects the words we use\nfor those concepts (\u201cthe Great War\u201d vs. \u201cWorld War I\u2019). In\nthis paper, we will examine both linguistic changes, such as\nchanges in the lexicon and grammar; and cultural phenomena,\nsuch as how we remember people and events.\n\nThe full dataset, which comprises over two billion\nculturomic trajectories, is available for download or\nexploration at www.culturomics.org.\n\nThe Size of the English Lexicon\nHow many words are in the English language (9)?\n\nWe call a 1-gram \u201ccommon\u201d if its frequency is greater\nthan one per billion. (This corresponds to the frequency of the\nwords listed in leading dictionaries (7).) We compiled a list of\nall common 1-grams im 1900, 1950, and 2000 based on the\nfrequency of each 1-gram in the preceding decade. These lists\ncontained 1,117,997 common 1-grams in 1900, 1,102,920 in\n1950, and 1,489,337 in 2000.\n\nNot all common 1-grams are English words. Many fell\ninto three non-word categories: (i) 1-grams with non-\nalphabetic characters (\u201c\u201818r\u2019\u201d, \u201c3.14159\u201d); (i) misspellings\n(\u201cbecuase, \u201cabberation\u201d); and (111) foreign words\n(\u201csensitivo\u201d).\n\nTo estimate the number of English words, we manually\nannotated random samples from the lists of common 1-grams\n(7) and determined what fraction were members of the above\nnon-word categories. The result ranged from 51% of all\ncommon 1|-grams in 1900 to 31% in 2000.\n\nUsing this technique, we estimated the number of words in\nthe English lexicon as 544,000 in 1900, 597,000 in 1950, and\n1,022,000 in 2000. The lexicon is enjoying a period of\n\nenormous growth: the addition of ~8500 words/year has\nincreased the size of the language by over 70% during the last\nfifty years (Fig. 2A).\n\nNotably, we found more words than appear in any\ndictionary. For instance, the 2002 Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary [W3], which keeps track of the\ncontemporary American lexicon, lists approximately 348,000\nsingle-word wordforms (/0); the American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (AHD4)\nlists 116,161 (//). (Both contain additional multi-word\nentries.) Part of this gap is because dictionaries often exclude\nproper nouns and compound words (\u201cwhalewatching\u201d). Even\naccounting for these factors, we found many undocumented\nwords, such as \u201caridification\u201d (the process by which a\ngeographic region becomes dry), \u201cslenthem\u201d (a musical\ninstrument), and, appropriately, the word \u201cdeletable.\u201d\n\nThis gap between dictionaries and the lexicon results from\na balance that every dictionary must strike: it must be\ncomprehensive enough to be a useful reference, but concise\nenough to be printed, shipped, and used. As such, many\ninfrequent words are omitted. To gauge how well dictionaries\nreflect the lexicon, we ordered our year 2000 lexicon by\nfrequency, divided it into eight deciles (ranging from 10\u00b0 \u2014\n10\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 \u2014 10\u00b0), and sampled each decile (7). We manually\nchecked how many sample words were listed in the OED (12)\nand in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD].\n(We excluded proper nouns, since neither OED nor MWD\nlists them.) Both dictionaries had excellent coverage of high\nfrequency words, but less coverage for frequencies below 10\u00b0\n\u00b0: 67% of words in the 10\u00b0 \u2014 10\u00b0 range were listed in neither\ndictionary (Fig. 2B). Consistent with Zipf\u2019s famous law, a\nlarge fraction of the words in our lexicon (63%) were in this\nlowest frequency bin. As a result, we estimated that 52% of\nthe English lexicon \u2014 the majority of the words used in\nEnglish books \u2014 consists of lexical \u201cdark matter\u201d\nundocumented in standard references (/2).\n\nTo keep up with the lexicon, dictionaries are updated\nregularly (/3). We examined how well these changes\ncorresponded with changes in actual usage by studying the\n2077 1-gram headwords added to AHD4 in 2000. The overall\nfrequency of these words, such as \u201cbuckyball\u201d and\n\u201cnetiquette\u201d, has soared since 1950: two-thirds exhibited\nrecent, sharp increases in frequency (>2X from 1950-2000)\n(Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, there was a lag between\nlexicographers and the lexicon. Over half the words added to\nAHD4 were part of the English lexicon a century ago\n(frequency >10\u00b0 from 1890-1900). In fact, some newly-\nadded words, such as \u201cgypseous\u201d and \u201camplidyne\u201d, have\nalready undergone a steep decline in frequency (Fig. 2D).\n\nNot only must lexicographers avoid adding words that\nhave fallen out of fashion, they must also weed obsolete\nwords from earlier editions. This is an imperfect process.

Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes\nand they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that. Mr. Ballentine asked how far out\nthey would be under the new rules. Mr. Walton said they would be given 24\nmonths which with the hurricane would be 25 months. Mr. Lynch said that at the\nend of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the\nrequired time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the\nexpiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down. Mr.\nWagner\u2019s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become\nirrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24\nmonth period.

He said some reduction should be considered\nbut he was not sure on what basis.\n\nMr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the\nmarket for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship. Mr. Lynch said he\ndid not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein\u2019s statement on that. Mr.\nLynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes\nmade and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension\nof time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice\nwith Town Council.\n\nMr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client\nwould be in a position to pay within the next two weeks. Mr. Hoffman said he\nwas concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they\nhad the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the\ntime they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day. Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman,\nadvising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine\nthat was in effect was $250.00 a day.

Mr. Fried asked Mr.\nRandolph if he would explain the reason for this. Mr. Randolph said the argument\nhad been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been\ndeemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town\u2019s Code. Mr.\nRandolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday\nthat it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (1)\nbecause that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been\ndeclared dangerous. The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done\neverything he is required to do. Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further\nif the matter was going to be deferred. Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is\nthat item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through\n(h). It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to\nthe Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-\n45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the\nsections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code\nEnforcement Board and 10-45 is listed. Code Enforcement has the right to bring a\nviolation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set\nforth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in\nconsidering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting.\n\nMr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been\n\npresented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put\npressure on Dr. Lynn to comply.

On November\n15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started\nrunning. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008. The fine ran for 137\ndays prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is\n$34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.\n\nFrank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and Ajax.\n\nHe said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the\nprincipal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of\nPalm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code\nprovision. Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to\ncomplete the construction. At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow\nthem an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-\ncompliance and assess the $150 costs. After a significant amount of discussion,\nthat motion went to a vote and failed 4-3. A second motion was made and Ms.\nDuemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be\n$125.00 a day. Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the\nrecord. As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms.\nDuemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like\nthem to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a\nlegitimate mistake. As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept\nsome level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did. The construction\nwas continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process\nitself. This was not someone\u2019s house, it was a speculative venture. There had\nbeen some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were\nsignificant enough that there were substantial delays. At that same hearing, Code\nEnforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get\nmore assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to\nbe more aggressively pursued. Under the new ordinance, for a house of\napproximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months.

Now we must turn back to left\ncybernetics\u2014theoretical biologists and anthropologists engaged with a trans-species\nunderstanding of intelligent systems. Gregory Bateson\u2019s observation that corporations\nmerely simulate \u201caggregates of parts of persons,\u201d with profit-maximizing decisions cut\noff from \u201cwider and wiser parts of the mind,\u201d has never been more timely.\u201d\n\nThe cybernetic epistemology offered here suggests a new approach. The\nindividual mind is immanent, not only in the body but also in pathways outside the body,\nand there is a larger Mind, of which the individual mind is only a subsystem. This larger\nMind, Bateson holds, is comparable to God, and is perhaps what some people mean by\n\u201cGod,\u201d but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary\necology. This is not the collective delusion of an exterior \u201cGod\u201d who speaks from\noutside human consciousness (this long-seated monotheistic conceit, Bateson suggests,\nleads to views of nature and environment as also outside the \u201cindividual\u201d human,\nrendering them as \u201cgifts to exploit\u201d). Rather, Bateson\u2019s \u201cGod\u201d is a placeholder for our\nevanescent experience of interacting consciousness-in-the-world: larger Mind as a result\nof inputs and actions that then become inputs for other actions in concert with other\nentities\u2014webs of symbiotic relationships that form patterns we need urgently to sense\nand harmonize with.\u00b0+\n\nFrom Tsai in the 1970s to Hershman Leeson in the 1990s to Parreno in 2014,\nartists have been critiquing right cybernetics and plying alternative, embodied,\nenvironmental experiences of \u201cartificial\u201d intelligence.

Analysis of this\ncorpus enables us to investigate cultural trends\nquantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of\n\u201cculturomics\u201d, focusing on linguistic and cultural\nphenomena that were reflected in the English language\nbetween 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can\nprovide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography,\nthe evolution of grammar, collective memory, the\nadoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship,\nand historical epidemiology. \u201cCulturomics\u201d extends the\nboundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide\narray of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and\nthe humanities.\n\nReading small collections of carefully chosen works enables\nscholars to make powerful inferences about trends in human\nthought. However, this approach rarely enables precise\nmeasurement of the underlying phenomena. Attempts to\nintroduce quantitative methods into the study of culture (/-6)\nhave been hampered by the lack of suitable data.\n\nWe report the creation of a corpus of 5,195,769 digitized\nbooks containing ~4% of all books ever published.\nComputational analysis of this corpus enables us to observe\ncultural trends and subject them to quantitative investigation.\n\u201cCulturomics\u201d extends the boundaries of scientific inquiry to\na wide array of new phenomena.\n\nThe corpus has emerged from Google\u2019s effort to digitize\nbooks. Most books were drawn from over 40 university\nlibraries around the world. Each page was scanned with\n\ncustom equipment (7), and the text digitized using optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR). Additional volumes \u2014 both\nphysical and digital \u2014 were contributed by publishers.\nMetadata describing date and place of publication were\nprovided by the libraries and publishers, and supplemented\nwith bibliographic databases. Over 15 million books have\nbeen digitized [12% of all books ever published (7)]. We\nselected a subset of over 5 million books for analysis on the\nbasis of the quality of their OCR and metadata (Fig. 1A) (7).\nPeriodicals were excluded.\n\nThe resulting corpus contains over 500 billion words, in\nEnglish (361 billion), French (45B), Spanish (45B), German\n(37B), Chinese (13B), Russian (35B), and Hebrew (2B). The\noldest works were published in the 1500s. The early decades\nare represented by only a few books per year, comprising\nseveral hundred thousand words. By 1800, the corpus grows\nto 60 million words per year; by 1900, 1.4 billion; and by\n2000, 8 billion.\n\nThe corpus cannot be read by a human. If you tried to read\nonly the entries from the year 2000 alone, at the reasonable\npace of 200 words/minute, without interruptions for food or\nsleep, it would take eighty years. The sequence of letters is\none thousand times longer than the human genome: if you\nwrote it out in a straight line, it would reach to the moon and\nback 10 times over (8).\n\nTo make release of the data possible in light of copyright\nconstraints, we restricted our study to the question of how\noften a given \u201c1-gram\u201d or \u201cn-gram\u201d was used over time.

Whether anyone could actually map the\nquiddities of the program (or glean its reactionary gender theater) without reading the\ncatalog essay is an open question. What is significant is Pask\u2019s focus on the behaviors of\nhis automata, their interactivity, their responsiveness within an artificially modulated\nenvironment, and their \u201creflection\u201d of human behaviors.\n\nThe ICA\u2019s \u201cCybernetic Serendipity\u201d introduced an important paradigm: the\nmachinic ecosystem, in which the viewer was a biological part, tasked with figuring out\njust what the triggers for interaction might be. The visitors in those London galleries\nsuddenly became \u201ccybernetic organisms\u201d\u2014cyborgs\u2014since to experience the art\nadequately, one needed to enter a kind of symbiotic colloquy with the servomechanisms.\nThis turn toward human-machine interactive environments as an aesthetic becomes\nclearer when we examine a few other artworks from the period, beginning with one\nconstituting an early instance of emergent behavior\u2014Senster, the interactive sculpture by\nartist/engineer Edward Ihnatowicz (1970), celebrated by medical robotics engineer Alex\nZivanovic, editor of a Web site devoted to Ihnatowicz\u2019s little-known career, as \u201cone of\nthe first computer controlled interactive robotic works of art.\u201d Here, \u201cthe computer\u201d\nmakes its entry (albeit a twelve-bit, limited device). But rather than \u201cintelligence,\u201d\nThnatowicz sought to make an avatar of affective behavior. Key to Senster \u2019s uncanny\nsuccess was the programming with which Ihnatowicz constrained the fifteen-foot-long\nhydraulic apparatus (its hinge design and looming appearance inspired by a lobster claw)\nto convey shyness in responding to humans in its proximity. Sensfer\u2019s sound channels\nand motion sensors were set to recoil at loud noises and sudden aggressive movements.\nOnly those humans willing to speak softly and modulate their gestures would be\nrewarded by Senster\u2019s quiet, inquisitive approach\u2014an experience that became real for\nThnatowicz himself when he first assembled the program and the machine turned to him\nsolicitously after he\u2019d cleared his throat.\n\nIn these artistic uses of cybernetic beings, we sense a growing necessity to train\nthe public to experience itself as embedded in a technologized environment, modifying\nitself to communicate intuitively with machines. This necessity had already become\nexplicit in Tsai\u2019s \u201cCybernetic Sculpture\u201d show. Those experiencing his immersive\ninstallation were expected to experiment with machinic life: What behaviors would\ntrigger the servomechanisms? Likely, the human gallery attendant would have had to\nexplain the protocol: \u201cClap your hands\u2014that gets the sculptures to respond.\u201d As an early\ncritic described it:\n\nA grove of slender stainless-steel rods rises from a plate. This base vibrates at 30\ncycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set in a dark room,\nthey are lit by strobes. The pulse of the flashing lights varies\u2014they are\nconnected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one\napproaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods\nappear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an cerie ballet of metal, whose\napparent movements range from stillness to jittering and back to a slow,\nindescribably sensuous undulation.\u201d\n\n\u00b0 Robert Hughes, Zime magazine (October 2, 1972) review of Tsai exhibition at Denise Ren\u00e9 gallery.\n\n176\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016979\n", "sample": "designer to craft a spindly \u201cmale\u201d apparatus of hinges and rods, set up to communicate\nwith bulbous \u201cfemale\u201d fiberglass entities nearby.

In terms of how to do programming,\nit\u2019s an interesting question. Take nanotechnology. How did we achieve nanotechnology?\nAnswer: We took technology as we understand it on a large scale and we made it very\nsmall. How to make a CPU chip on the atomic scale? Fundamentally, we use the same\narchitecture as the CPU chip we know and love. That isn\u2019t the only approach one can\ntake. Looking at what simple programs can do suggests that you can take even simple\nimpoverished components and with the right compiler you can make them do interesting\nthings. We don\u2019t do molecular-scale computing yet, because the ambient technology is\nsuch that you\u2019d have to spend a decade building it. But we\u2019ve got the components that\nare enough to make a universal computer. You might not know how to program with\nthose components, but by doing searches in the space of possible programs, you'd start to\namass building blocks, and you could then create a compiler for them. The surprising\nthing is that impoverished stuff is capable of doing sophisticated things, and the\ncompilation step is not as gruesome as you might expect.\n\nJust searching the computational universe and trying to find programs\u2014building\nblocks\u2014that are interesting is a good approach. A more traditional engineering\napproach\u2014trying by pure thought to figure out how to build a universal computer\u2014is a\nharder row to hoe. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done, but my guess is that we\u2019ll be able\nto do some amazing things just by finding the components and searching the possible\nprograms we can make with them. Then it\u2019s back to the question about connecting\nhuman purposes to what is available from the system.\n\nOne question I\u2019m interested in is, What will the world look like when most people\ncan write code? We had a transition, maybe five hundred years ago or so, when only\nscribes and a small set of the population could read and write natural language. Today, a\nsmall fraction of the population can write code. Most of the code they write is for\ncomputers only. You don\u2019t understand things by reading code. But there will come a\ntime when, as a result of things I\u2019ve tried to do, the code is at a high enough level that it\u2019s\na minimal description of what you\u2019 re trying to do. It will be a piece of code that\u2019s\nunderstandable to humans but also executable by the machines.\n\nCoding is a form of expression, just as writing in a natural language is a form of\nexpression. To me, some simple pieces of code are poetic\u2014they express ideas in a very\nclean way. There\u2019s an aesthetic aspect, much as there is to expression in a natural\nlanguage. One feature of code is that it\u2019s immediately executable; it\u2019s not like writing.\nWhen you write something, somebody has to read it, and the brain that\u2019s reading it has to\nabsorb the thoughts that came from the person who did the writing. Look at how\nknowledge has been transmitted in the history of the world. At level zero, one form of\nknowledge transmission is essentially genetic\u2014that is, there\u2019s an organism, and its\nprogeny has the same features that it had. Then there\u2019s the kind of knowledge\ntransmission that happens with things like physiological recognition. A newborn creature\nhas some neural network with some random connections in it, and as the creature moves\naround in the world, it starts recognizing kinds of objects and it learns that knowledge.\n\nThen there\u2019s the level that was the big achievement of our species, which is\nnatural language. The ability to represent knowledge abstractly enough that we can\ncommunicate it brain to brain, so to speak. Arguably, natural language is our species\u2019\nmost important invention. It\u2019s what led, in many respects, to our civilization.\n\n189\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016992\n", "sample": "How do you teach computational thinking?

That\u2019s what\nhumans contribute; that\u2019s what our civilization contributes. The execution of those goals\nis what we can increasingly automate. What will the future of humans be in such a\nworld? What will there be for them to do? One of my projects has been to understand\nthe evolution of human purposes over time. Today we\u2019ve got all kinds of purposes. If\nyou look back a thousand years, people\u2019s goals were quite different: How do I get my\nfood? How do I keep myself safe? In the modern Western world, for the most part you\ndon\u2019t spend a large fraction of your life thinking about those purposes. From the point of\nview of a thousand years ago, some of the goals people have today would seem utterly\nbizarre\u2014for example, like exercising on a treadmill. A thousand years ago that would\nsound like a crazy thing to do.\n\nWhat will people be doing in the future? A lot of purposes we have today are\ngenerated by scarcity of one kind or another. There are scarce resources in the world.\nPeople want to get more of something. Time itself is scarce in our lives. Eventually,\nthose forms of scarcity will disappear. The most dramatic discontinuity will surely be\nwhen we achieve effective human immortality. Whether this will be achieved\nbiologically or digitally isn\u2019t clear, but inevitably it will be achieved. Many of our\ncurrent goals are driven in part by our mortality: \u201c\u2019m only going to live a certain time, so\nI'd better get this or that done.\u201d And what happens when most of our goals are executed\nautomatically? We won\u2019t have the kinds of motivations we have today. One question I\u2019d\nlike an answer for is, What do the derivatives of humans in the future end up choosing to\ndo with themselves? One of the potential bad outcomes is that they just play video games\nall the time.\n\nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is evolving, in its use in technical language. These\ndays, Al is very popular, and people have some idea of what it means. Back when\ncomputers were being developed, in the 1940s and 1950s, the typical title of a book or a\nmagazine article about computers was \u201cGiant Electronic Brains.\u201d The idea was that just\nas bulldozers and steam engines and so on automated mechanical work, computers would\nautomate intellectual work. That promise turned out to be harder to fulfill than many\npeople expected. There was, at first, a great deal of optimism; a lot of government\nmoney got spent on such efforts in the early 1960s. They basically just didn\u2019t work.\n\nThere are a lot of amusing science-fiction-ish portrayals of computers in the\nmovies of that time. There\u2019s a cute one called Desk Set, which is about an IBM-type\ncomputer being installed in a broadcasting company and putting everybody out of a job.\nIt\u2019s cute because the computer gets asked a bunch of reference-library questions.

Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a\nculmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years. Sgt. Krauel\nexplained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some\ngraphic photographs. Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented\ncases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.\n\nMr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this\nprocedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr.\nRandolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.\nOriginally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation\nbut ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which\nwas appealed to Town Council. Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time,\nDr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation\nwas issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to\ndetermine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time,\nwhether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of\nthe Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council. Mr. Hoffman questioned\nwhether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized\nor removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the\nBoard\u2019s determination.

This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely\nacknowledges.\n\nAfter the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal\nCare and Control and after a hearing, was classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Sgt. Krauel\nnoted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify\nDuke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.\nAfter this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was\nalso found by the Town to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified\nby registered mail. Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was\ndenied by Town Council by a 5-0 vote. The Town recommends a finding of non-\ncompliance with Chapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required\naffidavits of residents of the Town occupying separate households. The Board\nwas provided with copies of four (4) affidavits.\n\nSgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and\nsaid the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of\nChapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) and that Dr. Lynn be given until July 18, 2008 to\ncome into compliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it\nhumanely euthanized. If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a\ndaily fine of $250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until\ncompliance is achieved.\n\nMr. Randolph requested the Board treat these two sections of the Code separate\nand apart. He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3) and\ninvolved the affidavits from the residents of the Town. Because of the dispute Dr.\nLynn\u2019s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied, Mr.\nRandolph recommended the two Code sections not be mixed up. Mr. Randolph\nsaid he would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a\nviolation of 10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the\nStaff's recommendation. He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained\nseparately after Dr. Lynn\u2019s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an\nopportunity to do so.\n\nVivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave., said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously\nattacked by Dr. Lynn\u2019s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in\nvet\u2019s bills. She said her dog will never walk properly again because of severe\nnerve damage. She does not feel there are enough precautions being taken for the\nsafety of residents on Brazilian Ave. She asked that the Board take this into\nconsideration and thanked them for their service.\n\nWayne Gerl, 149 Brazilian Ave., said he has two dogs and every time he exits his\ndriveway or front yard, he has to stop and peek around and make sure the other\n\n8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016561\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nSgt.

The bottom line is\nthat by the early seventies, that approach had crashed.\n\nThen there was a trend toward devices called expert systems, which arose in the\nlate seventies and early eighties. The idea was to have a machine learn the rules that an\nexpert uses and thereby figure out what to do. That petered out. After that, AI became\nlittle more than a crazy pursuit.\n\nI had been interested in how you make an AJI-like machine since I was a kid. I was\ninterested particularly in how you take the knowledge we humans have accumulated in\nour civilization and automate answering questions on the basis of that knowledge. I\nthought about how you could do that symbolically, by building a system that could break\ndown questions into symbolic units and answer them. I worked on neural networks at\nthat time and didn\u2019t make much progress, so I put it aside for a while.\n\nBack in mid-2002 to 2003, I thought about that question again: What does it take\nto make a computational knowledge system? The work I\u2019d done by then pretty much\nshowed that my original belief about how to do this was completely wrong. My original\nbelief had been that in order to make a serious computational knowledge system, you first\nhad to build a brainlike device and then feed it knowledge\u2014just as humans learn in\nstandard education. Now I realized that there wasn\u2019t a bright line between what is\nintelligent and what is simply computational.\n\nI had assumed that there was some magic mechanism that made us vastly more\ncapable than anything that was just computational. But that assumption was wrong. This\ninsight is what led to Wolfram|Alpha. What I discovered is that you can take a large\ncollection of the world\u2019s knowledge and automatically answer questions on the basis of\nit, using what are essentially merely computational techniques. It was an alternative way\nto do engineering\u2014a way that\u2019s much more analogous to what biology does in evolution.\n\nIn effect, what you normally do when you build a program 1s build it step-by-step.\nBut you can also explore the computational universe and mine technology from that\nuniverse. Typically, the challenge is the same as in physical mining: That is, you find a\nsupply of, let\u2019s say, iron, or cobalt, or gadolinium, with some special magnetic properties,\n\n184\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016987\n", "sample": "von Neumann and others on computers came directly not from Turing Machines but\nthrough this bypath of neural networks.\n\nBut simple neural networks didn\u2019t do much.

Not only is it\nunderstandable by brains and communicable to other brains and to computers, it\u2019s also\nimmediately executable.\n\nJust as natural language gave us civilization, knowledge-based programming will\ngive us\u2014what? One bad answer is that it will give us the civilization of the Als. That\u2019s\nwhat we don\u2019t want to happen, because the Als will do a great job communicating with\none another and we\u2019ll be left out of it, because there\u2019s no intermediate language, no\ninterface with our brains. What will this fourth level of knowledge communication lead\nto? If you were Caveman Ogg and you were just realizing that language was starting,\ncould you imagine the coming of civilization? What should we be imagining right now?\n\nThis relates to the question of what the world would look like if most people\ncould code. Clearly, many trivial things would change: Contracts would be written in\ncode, restaurant recipes might be written in code, and so on. Simple things like that\nwould change. But much more profound things would also change. The rise of literacy\ngave us bureaucracy, for example, which had already existed but dramatically\naccelerated, giving us a greater depth of governmental systems, for better or worse. How\ndoes the coding world relate to the cultural world?\n\nTake high school education. If we have computational thinking, how does that\naffect how we study history? How does that affect how we study languages, social\nstudies, and so on? The answer is, it has a great effect. Imagine you\u2019re writing an essay.\nToday, the raw material for a typical high school student\u2019s essay is something that\u2019s\nalready been written; students usually can\u2019t generate new knowledge easily. But in the\ncomputational world, that will no longer be true. If the students know something about\nwriting code, they\u2019ll access all that digitized historical data and figure out something\nnew. Then they\u2019ll write an essay about something they\u2019ve discovered. The achievement\nof knowledge-based programming is that it\u2019s no longer sterile, because it\u2019s got the\nknowledge of the world knitted into the language you\u2019 re using to write code.\n\nThere\u2019s computation all over the universe: in a turbulent fluid producing some\ncomplicated pattern of flow, in the celestial mechanics of planetary interactions, in\nbrains. But does computation have a purpose? You can ask that about any system. Does\nthe weather have a goal? Does climate have a goal?\n\nCan someone looking at Earth from space tell that there\u2019s anything with a purpose\nthere? Is there a civilization there? In the Great Salt Lake, in Utah, there\u2019s a straight\nline. It turns out to be a causeway dividing two areas of the lake with different colors of\nalgae, so it\u2019s a very dramatic straight line. There\u2019s a road in Australia that\u2019s long and\nstraight. There\u2019s a railroad in Siberia that\u2019s long, and lights go on when a train stops at\nthe stations. So from space you can see straight lines and patterns.\n\nBut are these clear enough examples of obvious purpose on Earth as viewed from\nspace? For that matter, how do we recognize extraterrestrials out there? How do we tell\nif a signal we\u2019re getting indicates purpose? Pulsars were discovered in 1967, when we\npicked up a periodic flutter every second or so.

As Wiener\nput it, \u201cWe have modified our environment so radically that we must now modify\nourselves in order to exist.\u201d*\u00ae The pressing question is: How are we modifying\nourselves? Are we going in the right direction or have we lost our way, becoming the\ntools of our tools? Revisiting the early history of humanist/artists\u2019 contribution to\ncybernetics may help direct us toward a less perilous, more ethical future.\n\nThe year 1968 was a high-water mark of the cultural diffusion and artistic uptake\nof the term. In that year, the Howard Wise gallery opened its show of Wen-Ying Tsai\u2019s\n\u201cCybernetic Sculpture\u201d in midtown Manhattan, and Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jasia Reichardt opened\nher exhibition \u201cCybernetic Serendipity\u201d at London\u2019s ICA. (The \u201cCybernetic\u201d in her title\nwas intended to evoke \u201cmade by or with computers,\u201d even though most of the artworks\non view had no computers, as such, in their responsive circuits.) The two decades\nbetween 1948 and 1968 had seen both the fanning out of cybernetic concepts into a\nbroader culture and the spread of computation machines themselves in a slow migration\nfrom proprietary military equipment, through the multinational corporation, to the\nacademic lab, where access began to be granted to artists. The availability of cybernetic\ncomponents\u2014\u201csensor organs\u201d (electronic eyes, motion sensors, microphones) and\n\u201ceffector organs\u201d (electronic \u201cbreadboards,\u201d switches, hydraulics, pneumatics)\u2014on the\nhome hobbyist front rendered the computer less an \u201celectronic brain\u201d than an adjunct\norgan in a kit of parts. There was not yet a ruling metaphor of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\nSo artists were bricoleurs of electronic bodies, interested in actions rather than calculation\nor cognition. There were inklings of \u201ccomputer\u201d as calculator in the drive toward Homo\nrationalis, but more in aspiration than achievement.\n\nIn light of today\u2019s digital convergence in art/science imaging tools, Reichardt\u2019s\nshow was prophetic in its insistence on confusing the boundaries between art and what\nwe might dub \u201ccreative applied science.\u201d According to the catalog, \u201cno visitor to the\nexhibition, unless he reads all the notes relating to all the works, will know whether he is\nlooking at something made by an artist, engineer, mathematician, or architect.\u201d So the\ncomically dysfunctional robot by Nam June Paik, Robot K-456 (1964), featured on the\ncatalog\u2019s cover and described as \u201ca female robot known for her disturbing and\nidiosyncratic behavior,\u201d would face off against a balletic Colloquy of Mobiles (1968)\nfrom second-order cybernetician Gordon Pask.

He is the creator of the symbolic computation program Mathematica and its\nprogramming language, Wolfram Language, as well as the knowledge engine\nWolfram|Alpha. He is also the author of A New Kind of Science.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript from a live interview with him conducted in\nDecember 2015.\n\nI see technology as taking human goals and making them automatically executable by\nmachines. Human goals of the past have entailed moving objects from here to there,\nusing a forklift rather than our own hands. Now the work we can do automatically, with\nmachines, is mental rather than physical. It\u2019s obvious that we can automate many of the\ntasks we humans have long been proud of doing ourselves. What\u2019s the future of the\nhuman condition in that situation?\n\nPeople talk about the future of intelligent machines and whether they\u2019 II take over\nand decide what to do for themselves. But the inventing of goals is not something that\nhas a path to automation. Someone or something has to define what a machine\u2019s purpose\nshould be\u2014what it\u2019s trying to execute. How are goals defined? For a given human, they\ntend to be defined by personal history, cultural environment, the history of our\ncivilization. Goals are uniquely human. Where the machine is concerned, we can give it\na goal when we build it.\n\nWhat kinds of things have intelligence, or goals, or purpose? Right now, we\nknow one great example, and that\u2019s us\u2014our brains, our human intelligence. Human\nintelligence, I once assumed, is far beyond anything else that exists naturally in the\nworld; it\u2019s the result of an elaborate process of evolution and thus stands apart from the\nrest of existence. But what I\u2019ve realized, as a result of the science I\u2019ve done, is that this is\nnot the case.\n\nPeople might say, for instance, \u201cThe weather has a mind of its own.\u201d That\u2019s an\nanimist statement and seems to have no place in modern scientific thinking. But it\u2019s not\nas silly as it sounds. What does the human brain do? A brain receives certain input, it\ncomputes things, it causes certain actions to happen, it generates a certain output. Like\nthe weather. All sorts of systems are, effectively, doing computations\u2014whether it\u2019s a\nbrain or, say, a cloud responding to its thermal environment.\n\nWe can argue that our brains are doing vastly more sophisticated computations\nthan those in the atmosphere. But it turns out that there\u2019s a broad equivalence between\nthe kinds of computations that different kinds of systems do. This renders the question of\nthe human condition somewhat poignant, because it seems we\u2019re not as special as we\nthought. There are all those different systems of nature that are pretty much equivalent,\nin terms of their computational capabilities.\n\nWhat makes us different from all those other systems is the particulars of our\nhistory, which give us our notions of purpose and goals. That\u2019s a long way of saying that\nwhen the box on our desk thinks as well as the human brain does, what it still won\u2019t have,\nintrinsically, are goals and purposes. Those are defined by our particulars\u2014our particular\nbiology, our particular psychology, our particular cultural history.\n\n182\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016985\n", "sample": "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE FUTURE OF CIVILIZATION\nStephen Wolfram\n\nStephen Wolfram is a scientist, inventor, and the founder and CEO of Wolfram\nResearch.

More and more, the\nAls will suggest to us what we should do, and I suspect most of the time people will just\ngo along with that. It\u2019s good advice\u2014better than what you would have figured out for\nyourself,\n\nAs far as the takeover scenario is concerned, you can do terrible things with\ntechnology and you can do good things with technology. Some people will try to do\nterrible things with technology, and some people will try to do good things with\ntechnology. One of the things I like about today\u2019s technology is the equalization it has\nproduced. I used to be proud that I had a better computer than anybody I knew; now we\nall have the same kind of computers. We have the same smartphones, and pretty much\nthe same technology can be used by a decent fraction of the planet\u2019s 7 billion people. It\u2019s\nnot the case that the king\u2019s technology is different from everybody else\u2019s. That\u2019s an\nimportant advance.\n\nThe great frontier five hundred years ago was literacy. Today, it\u2019s doing\nprogramming of some kind. Today\u2019s programming will be obsolete in a not very long\ntime. For example, people no longer learn assembly language, because computers are\nbetter at writing assembly language than humans are, and only a small set of people need\nto know the details of how language gets compiled into assembly language. A lot of\nwhat\u2019s being done by armies of programmers today is similarly mundane. There\u2019s no\ngood reason for humans to be writing Java code or JavaScript code. We want to\nautomate the programming process so that what\u2019s important goes from what the human\nwants done to getting the machine, as automatically as possible, to doit. This will\nincrease that equalization, which is something I\u2019m interested in. In the past, if you\nwanted to write a serious piece of code, or program for something important and real, it\nwas a lot of work. You had to know quite a bit about software engineering, you had to\ninvest months of time in it, you had to hire programmers who knew this or you had to\nlearn it yourself. It was a big investment.\n\nThat\u2019s not true anymore. A one-line piece of code already does something\ninteresting and useful. It allows a vast range of people who couldn\u2019t make computers do\nthings for them, make computers do things for them. Something Id like to see is a lot of\nkids around the world learn the new capabilities of knowledge-based programming and\nthen produce code that\u2019s effectively as sophisticated as what anybody in the top ranks can\nproduce. This is within reach. We\u2019re at the point where anybody can learn to do\nknowledge-based programming, and, more important, learn to think computationally.\nThe actual mechanics of programming are easy now. What\u2019s difficult is imagining things\nin a computational way.\n\n188\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016991\n", "sample": "People worry about the scenario in which Als take over.

Mr. Merola read subsection (h) into the record\nand said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any jurisdiction over\nsubsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g). The Town filed a\nlawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy this morning. The Town\nis asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and asking for a permanent\ninjunction, stating an emergency situation. Judge Hoy gave them a hearing at 1:30\np-m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the dog is a nuisance,\nwhether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board has authority over\n10-45 (1). If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not going to argue with the\nCourt but he believes they have a right to present their case. He does not believe\nthe Town\u2019s position that the fine should start tomorrow is correct. He believes the\nBoard can only find violations of subsections (d) through (g) of 10-45. There have\nbeen no allegations that Dr. Lynn has violated subsections (d) through (g). Mr.\nMerola believes it is clear that the Code Enforcement Board has no authority\nunder (i).

Mr. Merola said Mr. Randolph has asked them\nto determine these two (2) ordinances separately and he does not believe 10-45 (1)\nis in the Board\u2019s purview, and as to the nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now\nand it is not.

The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog\ndangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008\nand was told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County. A notice\ncould not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with something\nhe was already in compliance with. The dog was not in the Town. The police\ndepartment did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20\" when Laura Klein\nreported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is\nwhen the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45. Dr. Lynn\nwas given the entire ordinance on June 10\", not just sections or specific acts that\nhe needed to comply with. Duke was not on the property at that time and no\nnotification to remove the dog from the property could be served then because the\ndog was not there. As far as the police department was concerned, Dr. Lynn was\nin compliance with the ordinance. Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the Town does not\nabide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the ability to\nenforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have done here.\n\nSgt.

He said he\nwas not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog\ntaken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was\nagreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as\ndangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required.

There were previous attempts by Gottlob Frege and Giuseppe\nPeano that were a little more modest in their presentation. Ultimately, they were wrong\nin what they thought they should formalize: They thought they should formalize some\nprocess of mathematical proof, which turns out not to be what most people care about.\n\nWith regard to a modern analog of the Turing Test, it\u2019s an interesting question.\nThere\u2019s still the conversational bot, which is Turing\u2019s idea. That one hasn\u2019t been solved\nyet. It will be solved\u2014the only question is, What is the application for which it is\nsolved? For along time I would ask, \u201cWhy should we care?\u201d\u2014because I thought the\nprincipal application would be customer service, which wasn\u2019t particularly high on my\nlist. But customer service, where you\u2019 re trying to interface, 1s just where you need this\nconversational language.\n\nOne big difference between Turing\u2019s time and ours is the method of\ncommunicating with computers. In his time, you typed something into the machine and it\ntyped back a response. In today\u2019s world, it responds with a screen\u2014as for instance, when\nyou want to buy a movie ticket. How is a transaction with a machine different from a\ntransaction with a human? The main answer is that there\u2019s a visual display. It asks you\nsomething, and you press a button, and you can see the result immediately. For example,\nin Wolfram|Alpha, when it\u2019s used inside Sin, if there\u2019s a short answer, Siri will tell you\nthe short answer. But what most people want is the visual display, showing the\ninfographic of this or that. This is a nonhuman form of communication that turns out to\nbe richer than the traditional spoken, or typed, human communication. In most human-\nto-human communication, we\u2019re stuck with pure language, whereas in computer-to-\nhuman communication we have this much higher bandwidth channel\u2014of visual\ncommunication.\n\nMany of the most powerful applications of the Turing Test fall away now that we\nhave this additional communication channel. For example, here\u2019s one we\u2019re pursuing\nright now. It\u2019s a bot that communicates about writing programs: You say, \u201cI want to\nwrite a program. I want it to do this.\u201d The bot will say, \u201cI\u2019ve written this piece of\nprogram. This is what it does. Is this what you want?\u201d Blah-blah-blah. It\u2019s a back-and-\nforth bot. Devising such systems is an interesting problem, because they have to have a\nmodel of a human if they\u2019re trying to explain something to you. They have to know what\nthe human is confused about.\n\nWhat has long been difficult for me to understand is, What\u2019s the point of a\nconventional Turing Test? What\u2019s the motivation? As a toy, one could make a little chat\nbot that people could chat with. That will be the next thing. The current round of deep\nlearning\u2014particularly, recurrent neural networks\u2014is making pretty good models of\nhuman speech and human writing. We can type in, say, \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d\nand it knows most of the time what sort of response to give. But I want to figure out\nwhether I can automate responding to my email. I know the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d A good\nTuring Test, for me, will be when a bot can answer most of my email. That\u2019s a tough\ntest. It would have to learn those answers from the humans the email is connected to. I\nmight be a little bit ahead of the game, because I\u2019ve been collecting data on myself for\nabout twenty-five years.

I had established\nThe Reality Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met in New York City to\npresent their work before peers in other disciplines. (Note: In 1996, The Reality Club\nwent online as Edge.org). Our first speaker? Stephen Wolfram, a \u201cwunderkind\u201d who\nhad arrived in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study.

Comments:\n\nMr. Fried said he wanted to revisit the subject Mr. Raffo had enjoyed so much over the\npast couple of months, regarding outstanding fines. He requested an update on the\nprogress made in collecting some of them. Ms. Houston advised the outstanding water\nrestriction fines had been reduced to $6400.00 this month from over $9000.00 due the\nprevious month and liens were in the process of being filed for the remainder that had not\nbeen paid. The non-running fines either had liens filed or were agenda items which are\npending. Cases that had substantial fines and were not homesteaded would be looked at\nfor foreclosure proceedings. The list of the daily running fines indicated which of those\nproperties were homesteaded and Ms. Houston indicated she anticipated bringing some of\nthose non-homesteaded properties to the Board for foreclosure consideration next month.\n\nMr. Fried asked about the motion made by Mr. Raffo at the last meeting, requesting the\nTown Council to address the issue of giving final authority for foreclosure action to the\nCode Enforcement Board. He asked for an update from Mr. Randolph or Ms. Houston as\nto whether this would appear on the Town Council agenda. Mr. Randolph asked if the\nminutes of that last meeting had been sent to the Town Council and Ms. Houston told him\nthose were the minutes that had just been approved today by the Board so they would\nnow be sent to the Town Council. Mr. Randolph said since these minutes had now been\napproved, he would go ahead and call them to the attention of Peter Elwell and ask him to\nagenda it on the next meeting of the Council. Mr. Fried asked that the outstanding fines\nbe prioritized for foreclosure starting with the largest ones first. Ms. Houston said she\nwould address the oldest and the largest outstanding fines first. She said she had also\nwaited, based on the motion from the last meeting because it would be a different\nprocedure if it was just brought to the Code Enforcement Board for approval or if it came\nto them for final action.

People whose names did not appear in the cohorts for the time periods in question (1925-1933,\n1933-1945, and 1955-1965) were eliminated from the analysis.\n\nThe cohorts we generated were based on four major sources, and their content is given in Appendix.\n1) The Hermann lists\n\nThe lists of the infamous librarian Wolfgang Hermann were originally published in a librarianship journal\nand later in Boersenblatt, a publishing industry magazine in Germany. They are reproduced in Ref $11.A\ndigital version is available on the German-language version of Wikipedia (Ref $12). We considered\ndigitizing Ref $10 by hand to ensure accuracy, but felt that both OCR and manual entry would be time-\nconsuming and error prone. Consequently, we began with the list available on Wikipedia and hired a\nmanual annotator to compare this list with the version appearing in Ref $11 to ensure the accuracy of the\nresulting list. The annotator did not have access to our data and made these decisions purely on the\nbasis of the text of Ref $11. The following changes were made:\n\nLiterature\n1) \u201cFjodor Panfjorow\u2019 was changed to \u201cFjodor Panferov\u201d.\n2) \u201cNelly Sachs\u201d was deleted.\n\nHistory\n1) \u201cHegemann W. Ellwald, Fr. v.\u201d was changed to \u201cW. Hegemann\u201d and \u201cFr. Von Hellwald\u201d\n\nArt\n4) \u201cPaul Stefan\u201d was deleted.\n\nPhilosophy/Religion\n1) \u201cMax Nitsche\u2019\u201d was deleted.\n\nThe results of this manual correction process were used as our lists for Politics, Literature, Literary\nHistory, History, Art-related Writers, and Philosophy/Religion.\n\n2) The Berlin list\n\nThe lists of Hermann continued to be expanded by the Nazi regime. We also analyzed a version from\n1938 (Ref $13). This version was digitized by the City of Berlin to mark the 75\" year after the book\nburnings in 2008 (Ref S14). The list of authors appearing on the website occasionally included multiple\nauthors on a single line, or errors in which the author field did not actually contain the name of a person\nwho wrote the text. These were corrected by hand to create an initial list.\n\nWe noted that many authors were listed only using a last name and a first initial. Our manual annotator\nattempted to determine the full name of any such author. The results were far from comprehensive, but\ndid lead us to expand the dataset somewhat; names with only first initials were replaced by the full name\nwherever possible.\n\nSome authors were listed using a pseudonym, and on several occasions our manual annotator was able\nto determine the real name of the author who used a given pseudonym. In this case, the real name was\nadded to the list.\n\nIn addition, we occasionally included multiple spelling variants for a single author. Because of this, and\nbecause an author\u2019s real name and pseudonym may both be included on the list, the number of author\nnames on the list very slightly exceeds the number of individuals being examined. The numbers reported\nin the figure are the number of names on the list.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that Adolf Hitler appears as an author of one of the banned books from 1938. This\nis due to a French version of Mein Kampf, together with commentary, which was banned by the Nazi\nauthorities. Although it is extremely peculiar to find Hitler on a list of banned authors, we did not remove\nHitlers name, as we had no basis for doing so from the standpoint of the technical authorship and name\ncriteria described above: Adolf Hitler is indeed listed as the author of a book that was banned by the Nazi\nregime. This is consistent with our stance throughout the paper, which is that we avoided making\njudgments ourselves that could bias the outcome of our results. Instead, we relied strictly upon our\n\n27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017035\n", "sample": "fame.

This varies from corpus to corpus as described above. For English, we spent a great\ndeal of time examining the data by hand as an additional check on its reliability. The other corpora may\nnot be as reliable.\n\n4) Quality of Metadata. Again, the English language corpus was checked very carefully and\nsystematically on multiple occasions, as described above and in the following sections. The metadata for\nthe other corpora may not be equally reliable for all periods. In particular, the Hebrew corpus during the\n19th century is composed largely of reprinted works, whose original publication dates farpredate the\nmetadata date for the publication of the particular edition in question. This must be borne in mind for\nresearchers intent on working with that corpus.\n\nIn addition to these four general issues, we note that earlier portions of the Hebrew corpus contain a large\nquantity of Aramaic text written in Hebrew script. As these texts often oscillate back and forth between\nHebrew and Aramaic, they are particularly hard to accurately classify.\n\nAll the above issues will likely improve in the years to come. In the meanwhile, users must use extra\ncaution in interpreting the results of culturomic analyses, especially those based on the various non-\nEnglish corpora. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the main text, these corpora already contain a great\ntreasury of useful material, and we have therefore made them available to the scientific community\nwithout delay. We have no doubt that they will enable many more fascinating discoveries.\n\nIII.0.2 On the number of books published\n\nIn the text, we report that our corpus contains about 4% of all books ever published. Obtaining this\nestimate relies on knowing how many books are in the corpus (5,195,769) and estimating the total\nnumber of books ever published. The latter quantity is extremely difficult to estimate, because the record\nof published books is fragmentary and incomplete, and because the definition of book is itself\nambiguous.\n\nOne way of estimating the number of books ever published is to calculate the number of editions in the\ncomprehensive catalog of books which was described in Section | of the supplemental materials. This\nproduces an estimate of 129 million book editions. However, this estimate must be regarded with great\ncaution: it is conservative, and the choice of parameters for the clustering algorithm can lead to significant\nvariation in the results. More details are provided in Ref $1.\n\nAnother independent estimate we obtained in the study \"How Much Information? (2003)\" conducted at\nBerkeley (Ref S6). That study also produced a very rough estimate of the number of books ever\npublished and concluded that it was between 74 million and 175 million.\n\nThe results of both estimates are in general agreement. If the actual number is closer to the low end of\nthe Berkeley range, then our 5 million book corpus encompasses a little more than 5% of all books ever\npublished; if it is at the high end, then our corpus would constitute a little less than 3%. We report an\napproximate value (about 4%) in the text; it is clear that, in the coming years, more precise estimates of\nthe denominator will become available.\n\nIII.1. Generation of timeline plots\n\nIII.1A. Single Query\n\nThe timeline plots shown in the paper are created by taking the number of appearances of an n-gram ina\ngiven year in the specified corpus and dividing by the total number of words in the corpus in that year.\nThis yields a raw frequency value.

At least in\ncommon law countries, enforcement decisions are the province of police and prosecutor discretion, and oversight of officials\u2019\nfailures to enforce has been left almost wholly to the political process. Decisions to search, arrest, or charge face modest\njudicial scrutiny on evidentiary grounds and - at the extreme margins - racial or [*846] ethnic bias. \u00b0 Decisions not to arrest or\ncharge are virtually immune from judicial review or other nonpolitical oversight. !\u00b0 Like other common law jurisdictions, U.S.\njustice systems have always rejected an approach long adopted in some civil law jurisdictions to prevent unjustified and\ndisparate nonenforcement - a rule of mandatory prosecution that restricts executive officials\u2019 discretion over arrest and charging\ndecisions. |!\n\nA broader view, however, reveals that all criminal justice systems incorporate one or more strategies to address\nunderenforcement, which can be collectively described as redundant charging authority. All are to some degree familiar,\nthough they are not usually described in these terms or understood as serving this common purpose.\n\nOne approach is creation of two distinct enforcement agencies with overlapping or duplicative jurisdiction.

L. Rev. 844, *902\n\nResponses to unjustified police violence reveal a third outcome for enforcement redundancy confined to the federalism model.\nFederal enforcement authority extends to cases of police violence to a much greater degree than for sexual assaults. That\nauthority extends as well to other kinds of bias-motivated wrongdoing by both private actors and government officials, which\nlocal police and prosecutors have at times ignored or devalued, and for which state-level enforcement commitment continues to\nbe uneven. !\u201d Federal jurisdiction is coextensive with state jurisdiction regarding police wrongdoing, and the Justice\nDepartment's institutional capacity for enforcement probably exceeds that of its state counterparts, but in one respect the\noverlap is not complete. The key substantive criminal offenses available to prosecutors in the federal code are somewhat more\nrestrictive. The primary federal statute used to charge cases of [*903] police excessive use of force requires proof of willful\n\ndeprivation of rights, 7\u00b0\u00b0\n\na strict mens rea standard that makes it harder for federal prosecutors to prove liability than it would\nbe for state prosecutors relying on typical assault or homicide offense definitions. 7\u00b0! The fact that Congress has for decades\nlet stand this mens rea hurdle to excessive-force prosecutions suggests that federal legislators, if not Justice Department\nofficials, are less committed to a full federal-state enforcement redundancy - or \"to altering the federal-state balance in order to\nreinforce state law enforcement\" - than they are for public corruption offenses. 7\u00b0\n\nThat limit notwithstanding, federal prosecutions in this area have a track record of succeeding where state prosecutions failed\nor were never attempted, and in that way providing at least a partial remedy for underenforcement by state criminal justice\nofficials. Much of the federal advantage comes from the fact that federal prosecutors are, in general, better situated to\nobjectively investigate, assess, and prosecute wrongdoing by police officers than are local prosecutors who ordinarily interact\nwith and depend upon those officers (or at least their agencies). This is not a particular criticism of local prosecutors\u2019 offices; it\nis one instance of the basic problem that officials (and people generally) are untrustworthy judges of the conduct of others with\nwhom they have affiliations, allegiances, or ongoing relationships. For that reason a few states assign such cases to state-level,\nrather than local, officials. 7\u00b0? And the U.S. Justice Department attempts to collect data on deaths in jails, prison, or during\n[#904] attempted arrests, to facilitate Justice Department oversight. 7\u00b04 The same concerns motivate English laws applying\nspecial judicial scrutiny (when triggered by requests from victims' families) to prosecutor's decisions not to charge in the case\n\nof death caused by law enforcement officials or occurring in official custody. 7\u00b0\u00b0\n\n31 Some federal states such as Germany and Canada lack enforcement redundancy because they use a single, nationwide, criminal code,\nwhich is enforced for prosecution agencies and courts organized at the state or provincial level. See generally Eric P. Polten & Eric Glezl,\nFederalism in Canada and Germany: Overview and Comparison (2014) (describing similarities in German and Canadian federalism,\nincluding allocating authority over substantive criminal law to the federal government but criminal justice administration to state or\nprovincial prosecutors and courts). In Australia, like in the United States, states and the federal government each have their own criminal\ncodes. But Australian federal criminal authority is confined much more narrowly than in the United States to conduct that implicates a\ndistinct federal interest. See generally Arther B.

Having ruled out judicial\nreview and private prosecution from the imaginations of reform-movement activists, the only alternative is the one that U.S.\ncriminal justice always favors - federalism. Where federal criminal law takes on an enforcement agenda, it is usually effective.\n198 Where tradition, politics, jurisdictional limits, or policy [*902] choices restrict the reach of federal law, as with sexual\nassault, the U.S. justice system is largely out of options. States were willing to change substantive and procedural law in hopes\nof improving rape prosecutions, but not to infringe prosecutors' monopoly control of charging by expanding modes of judicial,\nadministrative, or private-party oversight.\n\n3. Police Violence\n\n27 New York granted courts nolle prosequi authority in 1829, during its era of private and judicially appointed prosecutors. McConville &\nMirsky, supra note 81, at 35 (citing 1829 N.Y. Rev. Stat. tit. IV, \u00a7 68, p.730 & \u00a7 54. p.726). For a broad overview of state nolle pros laws, see\nAnnotation, Power of Court to Enter Nolle Prosequi or Dismiss Prosecution, 69 A.L.R. 240 (1930). The federal rule is Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a).\nNote that these rules give judges implicit power to compel prosecutors to litigate charges they would rather dismiss. For decisions insisting on\njudicial deference, see, for example, Genesee Prosecutor v. Genesee Circuit Judge, 215 N.W.2d 145, 147-48 (Mich. 1974). For similar\nexamples in federal cases, see United States v. Smith, 55 F.3d 157, 159-60 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Perate, 719 F.2d 706, 710-11\n(4th Cir. 1983); United States v. Smith, 853 F.

A standard explanation for deference is that judges lack means to compel prosecutors to litigate charges at trial. See,\ne.g., United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors Ass'n, 228 F. Supp. 483, 489-90 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (\"Even were leave of\nCourt to the dismissal of the indictment denied, the Attorney General would still have the right to ... , in the exercise of his discretion, decline\nto move the case for trial. The Court in that circumstance would be without power to issue a mandamus or other order to compel prosecution\n\nof the indictment, since such a direction would invade the traditional separation of powers doctrine.\"). But judges have options short of\nmandamus. Presumably they could hold prosecutors in contempt for failures to appear, as they could for all other attorneys. And whenever\nprosecutors retain an interest charges they seek to dismiss, judges could incentivize them by ruling that failure to litigate charges results (as\nfor civil parties) in forfeiture of the claim, or dismissal with prejudice.\n\n28 For an overview of Canadian law on this point, see Mark Phillips, The Public Interest Criterion in Prosecutorial Discretion: A Lingering\nSource of Flexibility in the Canadian Criminal Process?, 36 Windsor Rev. Legal & Soc. Issues 43 (2015) (describing case law requiring great\njudicial deference to prosecutorial discretion).

In addition, many nineteenth-century state courts justified privately funded prosecutions by citing the\npublic value of these contributions to supplement underfunded district attorney offices. See Ireland, supra note 83, at 47, 49-51 (citing and\nquoting multiple state courts). Private prosecutors may have different reasons to proceed when despite comparatively low odds of winning a\nconviction. Some of those motivations, at least, can be public-regarding. Avlana Eisenberg makes the point that prosecuting hate crimes\ncases, for example, can have expressive and educative value that justifies pursuing well-grounded cases despite skeptical juries.

But in fact, some of the prominent contemporary\ncomplaints about U.S. criminal justice, as well as some longstanding ones, object to underenforcement of criminal law. Two of\nthe most notable categories are failures to prosecute in cases of unjustified police violence, especially against nonwhite victims,\nand in cases of sexual assaults. Lower-profile examples abound as well, as do historical examples.\n\nGiven the nation's history, underenforcement problems are often related to race. Insufficient law enforcement attention to\ncrimes in minority neighborhoods, for example, has been criticized as depriving African American victims and communities of\ntheir fair share of government protection from criminal harm. ? In earlier eras, law enforcement inattention to, or wholesale\nneglect [*845] of, white offenders' victimization of black victims - in lynchings, attacks on civil right activists, sexual assaults,\nand other contexts - was often patent. ? But the problem of unjustified underenforcement is not confined to these contexts, nor\nto the United States. Failures to prosecute arise from a fundamental structural challenge faced by all criminal justice systems:\nhow to ensure unbiased, evenhanded enforcement practices - safeguards in favor of justified enforcement. This challenge gets\nless attention than criminal procedure's central preoccupation of guarding against excessive or groundless criminal charges.\nConcern about misuse of the state's prosecution authority rightly motivates much in criminal procedure, from search and\nseizure rules * and judicial review of arrests > to evidence disclosure duties, \u00a9 the right to counsel, 7 and standards of proof. \u00a7\n\n! USS. incarceration rates quintupled over the last forty years and are five to seven times higher than those in other advanced democracies.\nSee Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F.

Many computers were used as these computations would\ntake many years on a single ordinary computer.\n\nNote that the ability to study the frequency of words or phrases in English over time was our primary focus\nin this study. As such, we went to significant lengths to ensure the quality of the general English corpora\nand their date metadata (i.e., Eng-all, Eng-1M, and Eng-Modern-1M). As a result, the accuracy of place-\nof-publication data in English is not as reliable as the accuracy of date metadata. In addition, the foreign\nlanguage corpora are affected by issues that were improved and largely eliminated in the English data.\nFor instance, their date metadata is not as accurate. In the case of Hebrew, the metadata for language is\nan oversimplification: a significant fraction of the earliest texts annotated as Hebrew are in fact hybrids\nformed from Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter written in Hebrew script.\n\nThe size of these base corpora is described in Tables S3-S6.\n\nIII. Culturomic Analyses\n\nIn this section we describe the computational techniques we use to analyze the historical n-grams\ncorpora.\n\nIlI.0. General Remarks\n\nIII.0.1 On Corpora.\n\nThere is significant variation in the quality of the various corpora during various time periods and their\nsuitability for culturomic research. All the corpora are adequate for the uses to which they are put in the\npaper. In particular, the primary object of study in this paper is the English language from 1800-2000; this\ncorpus during this period is therefore the most carefully curated of the datasets. However, to encourage\nfurther research, we are releasing all available datasets - far more data than was used in the paper. We\ntherefore take a moment to describe the factors a culturomic researcher ought to consider before relying\non results of new queries not highlighted in the paper.\n\n1) Volume of data sampled. Where the number of books used to count n-gram frequencies is too small,\nthe signal to noise ratio declines to the point where reliable trends cannot be discerned. For instance, if\nan n-gram's actual frequency is 1 part in n, the number of words required to create a single reliable\ntimepoint must be some multiple of n. In the English language, for instance, we restrict our study to years\npast 1800, where at least 40 million words are found each year. Thus an n-gram whose frequency is 1\npart per million can be reliably quantified with single-year resolution. In Chinese, there are fewer than 10\nmillion words per year prior to the year 1956. Thus the Chinese corpus in 1956 is not in general as\nsuitable for reliable quantification as the English corpus in 1800. (In some cases, reducing the resolution\nby binning in larger windows can be used to sample lower frequency n-grams in a corpus that is too smal\nfor single-year resolution.) In sum: for any corpus and any n-gram in any year, one must consider whether\nthe size of the corpus is sufficient to enable reliable quantitation of that n-gram in that year.\n\n2) Composition of the corpus. The full dataset contains about 4% of all books ever published, which\nlimits the extent to which it may be biased relative to the ensemble of all surviving books. Still, marked\nshifts in composition from one year to another are a potential source of error. For instance, book sampling\npatterns differ for the period before the creation of Google Books (2004) as compared to the period\nafterward. Thus, it is difficult to compare results from after 2000 with results from before 2000. As a result,\nsignificant changes in culturomic trends past the year 2000 may reflect corous composition issues. This\nwas an important reason for our choice of the period between 1800 and 2000 as the target period.\n\n12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017020\n", "sample": "The computations required to generate these corpora were performed at Google using the MapReduce\nframework for distributed computing (Ref $5).

They\nare generally all in agreement, but can denote distinct cultural effects. These distinctions are not explored\nin this paper.\n\nFor example, we give in Appendix measures for the frequency of the word \u2018evolution\u2019. In the first three\ncolumns, we give the number of times it appeared, the normalized number of times it appeared (relative\nto #words that year), the normalized number of pages it appeared in, and the normalized number of\nbooks it appeared in, as a function of the date.\n\nIII.1B. Multiple Query/Cohort Timelines\n\nWhere indicated, timeline plots may reflect the aggregates of multiple query results, such as a cohort of\nindividuals or inventions. In these cases, the raw data for each query we used to associate each year with\na set of frequencies. The plot was generated by choosing a measure of central tendency to characterize\nthe set of frequencies (either mean or median) and associating the resulting value with the corresponding\nyear.\n\nSuch methods can be confounded by the vast frequency differences among the various constituent\nqueries. For instance, the mean will tend to be dominated by the most frequent queries, which might be\nseveral orders of magnitude more frequent than the least frequent queries. If the absolute frequency of\nthe various query results is not of interest, but only their relative change over time, then individual query\nresults may be normalized so that they yield a total of 1. This results in a probability mass function for\neach query describing the likelihood that a random instance of a query derives from a particular year.\nThese probability mass functions may then be summed to characterize a set of multiple queries. This\napproach eliminates bias due to inter-query differences in frequency, making the change over time in the\ncohort easier to track.\n\nIlI.2. Note on collection of historical and cultural data\n\nIn performing the analyses described in this paper, we frequently required additional curated datasets of\nvarious cultural facts, such as dates of rule of various monarchs, lists of notable people and inventions,\nand many others. We often used Wikipedia in the process of obtaining these lists. Where Wikipedia is\nmerely digitizing the content available in another source (for instance, the blacklists of Wolfgang\nHermann), we corrected the data using the original sources. In other cases this was not possible, but we\nfelt that the use of Wikipedia was justifiable given that (i) the data \u2014 including all prior versions - is publicly\navailable; (ii) it was created by third parties with no knowledge of our intended analyses; and (iii) the\nspecific statistical analyses performed using the data were robust to errors; i.e., they would be valid as\nlong as most of the information was accurate, even if some fraction of the underlying information was\nwrong. (For instance, the aggregate analysis of treaty dates as compared to the timeline of the\ncorresponding treaty, shown in the control section, will work as long as most of the treaty names and\ndates are accurate, even if some fraction of the records is erroneous.\n\nWe also used several datasets from the Encyclopedia Britannica, to confirm that our results were\nunchanged when high-quality carefully curated data was used. For the lexicographic analyses, we relied\nprimarily on existing data from the American Heritage Dictionary.\n\nWe avoided doing manual annotation ourselves wherever possible, in an effort to avoid biasing the\nresults.

Because Adolf Hitler is only one of many names, the list as a whole nevertheless\nexhibits strong evidence of suppression, especially because the measure we retained (median usage) is\nrobust to such outliers.\n\n3) Degenerate artists\n\nThe list of degenerate artists was taken directly from the catalog of a recent exhibition at the Los Angeles\nCounty Museum of Art which endeavored to reconstruct the original \u2018Degenerate Art\u2019 exhibition (Ref $15).\n\n4) People with recorded ties to Nazis\n\nThe list of Nazi party members was generated in a manner consistent with the occupation categories in\nsection 7. We included the following Wikipedia categories: Nazis_from_outside_Germany, Nazi_leaders,\nSS_officers, _Holocaust_perpetrators, Officials_of_Nazi_Germany, Nazis_convicted_of_war_crimes,\ntogether with all of their subcategories, with the exception of Nazis_from_outside_Germany. |n addition,\nthe three categories German_Nazi_politicians, Nazi_physicians, Nazis were included without their\nrespective subcategories.\n\nIII.9B. De Novo Identification of Censored and Suppressed Individuals\n\nWe began with the list of 56,500 people, comprising the 500 most famous individuals born in each year\nfrom 1800 \u2014 1913. This list was derived from the analysis of all biographies in Wikipedia described in\nsection 7. We removed all individuals whose mean frequency in the German language corpus was less\nthan 5 x 10~ during the period from 1925 \u2014 1933; because their frequency is low, a statistical assessment\nof the effect of censorship and suppression on these individuals is more susceptible to noise.\n\nThe suppression index is computed for the remaining individuals using an observed/expected measure.\nThe expected fame for a given year is computed by taking the mean frequency of the individual in the\nGerman language from 1925-1933, and the mean frequency of the individual from 1955-1965. These two\nvalues are assigned to 1929 and 1960, respectively; linear interpolation is then performed in order to\ncompute an expected fame value in 1939. This expected value is compared to the observed mean\nfrequency in the German language during the period from 1933-1945. The ratio of these two numbers is\nthe suppression index s. The complete list of names and suppression indices is included as supplemental\ndata. The distribution of s was plotted for using a logarithmic binning strategy, with 100 bins between 10\u00b0\nand 10\u00b0. Three specific individuals who received scores indicating suppression in German are indicated\non the plot by arrows (Walter Gropius, Pablo Picasso, and Hermann Maas).\n\nAs a point of comparison, the entire analysis was repeated for English; these results are shown on the\nplot.\n\nIII.9C. Validation by an expert annotator\n\nWe wanted to see whether the findings of this high-throughput, quantitative approach were consistent\nwith the conclusions of an expert annotator using traditional, qualitative methods. We created a list of 100\nindividuals at the extremes of our distribution, including the names of the fifty people with the largest s\nvalue and of the fifty people with the smallest s value. We hired a guide at Yad Vashem with advanced\ndegrees in German and Jewish literature to manually annotate these 100 names based on her\nassessment of which people were suppressed by the Nazis (S), which people would have benefited from\nthe Nazi regime (B), and lastly, which people would not obviously be affected in either direction (N).

L. Rev. 844, *847\n\nlaw enforcement substantially overlap for many categories of crime. Much of this enforcement redundancy, as considered in\ndetail below, has been a deliberate federal response to diverse problems of underenforcement in state criminal justice. The\npoint for now, however, is the functional equivalence of duplicative federal-state jurisdiction, nation-state jurisdiction, and\nagency jurisdiction. All represent a common strategy to reduce underenforcement by empowering redundant enforcement\nauthorities: independent entities with equivalent institutional capacity and expertise share jurisdiction. If one neglects to\nenforce, the other may. Functionally, each backstops, or provides oversight of, failures to enforce by the other.\n\nA second model for minimizing unjustified failures to prosecute relies on private actors to create redundancy with public\nprosecutors\u2019 authority. Empowering private actors to file and litigate public law claims is familiar in many civil law contexts;\nnumerous federal statutes authorize private rights of action that enable private individuals or groups to supplement public\nagencies\u2019 law enforcement efforts. '>5 Through much of the nineteenth century, this kind of duplicative public-private\nenforcement authority was a familiar feature in the criminal justice systems of many states, which permitted private parties -\nvictims - to prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing.\n\nRedundant charging authority takes other forms as well. In large hierarchical agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice,\ninternal administrative review of front-line prosecutors\u2019 charging or declination decisions by higher-ups creates a version of\nredundant enforcement authority; supervisors can make independent determinations and reverse front-line prosecutors. |!\u00b0\n[*848] This kind of redundancy through administrative review now exists in English, Irish, and many European criminal\njustice systems. !7\nMore ambitiously from a U.S. perspective - because it is rare here - judicial power to review prosecutorial charging decisions is\nanother means to create some degree of redundant charging authority between the executive and judicial branches. Although\ncriminal charging is a core function of the executive branch, state and federal courts have modest authority to review and bar\nexecutive officials\u2019 decisions to file criminal charges. It is only as a matter of policy that courts - with a few exceptions - are not\nempowered to address underenforcement by reviewing the executive's noncharging decisions. (This power is somewhat broader\nfor courts in England and Wales as well as in the law of a few states.) !8 This model of redundancy separates charging\nauthority - for courts as for Department of Justice supervisors, the power to order prosecutors to prosecute - from enforcement\nauthority, which includes the institutional capacity to file and litigate charges. Courts (with rare exceptions) have no\nadministrative capacity to litigate a prosecution; but they could provide some redundancy in charging authority. !?\n\nIn sum, charging redundancy can occur between equivalent agencies in separate governments, between public and private\nactors, or between agencies or branches of the same government. Criminal justice systems in Europe and the common law\nworld have adopted or strengthened one or more of these mechanisms in recent decades. In the United States, choices among\nthese strategies have changed over time and between jurisdictions. Nearly all states that once authorized private prosecution\nhave long since prohibited it. Federal prosecutors are organized in a centralized hierarchical agency that makes administrative\nreview possible, but few state prosecutors are similarly organized. For these reasons and others, the primary means of\nenforcement redundancy to combat underenforcement is overlapping federal- [*849] state authority made possible by the\ndistinctive U.S. model of federalism.\n\n\u20185 Examples of federal statutes authorizing private rights of action include the Clayton Act, 75 U.S.C. \u00a7 /5 (2006) (granting a private right of\naction for antitrust violations); Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (1994); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 ULS.C. \u00a7\n2000e-5(f) (1994); Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12/33 (1994). For an overview, see Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S.\nCal. L. Rev. 1, 12-54 (2002).\n\n16 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(f) (2012) (mandating review of federal prosecutor decisions within the Justice Department upon victim's request).\n7 See infra Part IT.A.1.\n18 See infra Parts II-B.3-B.4.\n\n19 Note that this conception of redundant authority intersects with, but is distinct from, constitutional separation of powers. In a standard\naccount (briefly put), separation of powers describes branches of government having distinct roles, authority, and competencies. In the main,\nbranches do not do the same things; they do different, rival, and complementary things. But if so empowered by the legislature, courts can\nexercise some degree of charging authority, creating limited redundancy in charging authority between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016512\n", "sample": "Page 3 of 42\n103 Minn.

Rev. 844, *849\n\nThis Article has several aims. One is to introduce the concept of enforcement redundancy and demonstrate its utility. Another is\nto highlight problems of criminal law underenforcement and to situate contemporary complaints about failures to prosecute\npolice violence and sexual assaults as specific examples of broader enforcement deficiencies that stem from bias and favoritism\nin police and prosecutorial discretion. The Article also defends the observation that enforcement redundancy strategies are\nresponses to versions of this problem. It then assesses the strengths and weaknesses of different such strategies, with primary\nattention on the effectiveness of the U.S. approach of redundant federal-state authority. A focus on three different categories of\ncriminal law underenforcement - government corruption, police violence, and sexual assaults - clarifies differences in the\neffectiveness of the U.S. approach. Federalism has proven an effective response to states\u2019 failures to address forms of public\ncorruption, and for those crimes, it 1s likely superior to its alternatives. Federal authority has had some success in compensating\nfor states' failures to prosecute police violence and other police wrongdoing, but its efficacy is harder to judge and arguments\nfor supplemental redundancy strategies are stronger. For sexual assaults, federal authority has failed to assert any meaningful\nenforcement jurisdiction to compensate for weaknesses in state justice systems. Despite the sustained efforts and notable\nsuccesses of reform advocates in this area, no model of enforcement redundancy has made inroads.\n\nThe Article proceeds as follows. Part II briefly surveys evidence of and reasons for underenforcement. The need for safeguards\nagainst unjustified nonenforcement has long been recognized in the United States and elsewhere; outside the United States, as\npart of victims\u2019 rights reforms, it has been the object of institutional reforms. Part III elaborates the mechanisms available to\naddress risks of criminal law underenforcement. The predominant options are (1) some authority for private actors to initiate or\nparticipate in criminal prosecutions; (2) judicial or administrative review of initial nonprosecution decisions by public\nprosecutors; and (3) authority for a separate, independent public prosecutor's office to bring charges when another prosecutor\nhas declined to. Other countries - out of tradition, an absence of federalism, or as part of victims\u2019 rights reforms - rely on\nversions of [*850] the first and second options. Part III also considers why U.S. victims\u2019 rights laws, which are otherwise\nrobust, lack either of these components adopted elsewhere, especially given that many state criminal justice systems relied on\nprivate prosecution for much of the nineteenth century. The likely answers help explain why the United States relies almost\nexclusively on the third option as a safeguard against underenforcement.\n\nFinally, Part IV assesses how effectively federalism-based enforcement redundancy addresses underenforcement, particularly\nthe recurrent, contemporary controversies around police violence and sexual assault. Redundant enforcement through\noverlapping federalism has had considerable success addressing some underenforcement problems, such as corruption by state\nand local officials, certain kinds of civil rights violations, or crimes against disfavored minority groups. 7\u00b0 It is doubtful that\nprivate prosecution or judicial review could match its success. The federalism strategy has a more mixed record on the problem\nof unjustified police violence. Federal officials have succeeded where state officials have failed in overseeing reform of local\npolice departments to reduce police lawbreaking, and they occasionally prosecute and convict individual officers. 7! But the\n\nvast majority of incidents of police violence go unprosecuted, including most that lead to large civil settlements for victims. 77\n\n20 See, e.g., David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI 57 (2017) (describing \"corrupt sheriffs\nand police departments\" that failed to enforce the law and were unable to solve serial murders of Native American victims); Margaret\nBumham, The Long Civil Rights Act and Criminal Justice, 95 B.U_L.

We used three categories of such\nwords: heads of state (\u2018President Truman\u2019), treaties (\u2018Treaty of Versailles\u2019), and geographical name\nchange (\u2018Byelorussia\u2019 to \u2018Belarus\u2019). We used Wikipedia as a primary source of such words, and manually\ncurated the lists as described below. We computed the timeserie of each n-gram, centered it on the date\nof interest (year when the person became president, for instance), and normalized the timeserie by\noverall frequency. Then, we took the mean trajectory for each of the three cohorts, and plotted in Figure\n$5.\n\nThe list of heads of states include all US presidents and British monarchs who gained power in the 19\" or\n20\" centuries (we removed ambiguous names, such as \u2018President Roosevelt\u2019). The list of treaties is taken\nfrom the list of 198 treaties signed in the 19\" or 20\" centuries (S7); but we kept only the 121 names that\nreferred to only one known treaty, and that have non zero timeseries. The list of country name changes is\ntaken from Ref S8. The lists are given in APPENDIX.\n\nThe correspondence between the expected and observed presence of peaks was excellent. 42 out of 44\nheads of state had a frequency increase of over 10-fold in the decade after they took office (expected if\nthe year of interest was random: 1). Similarly, 85 out of 92 treaties had a frequency increase of over 10-\nfold in the decade after they were signed (expected: 2).

In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor,\nbut there has been suspicion since that time \u2014 voiced by members of the judiciary and the press\nalike \u2014 that prosecutors gave Epstein preferential treatment because of his wealth and his\npolitical connections to powerful men like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew.

We develop a method\nto identify the most common, relevant names used to refer to all individuals in our databases. This\nmethod enables us to deal with potentially complicated full names, sometimes including multiple titles and\nmiddle names. On the basis of the amount of biographical information regarding each individual, we\nresolve the ambiguity arising when multiple individuals share some part, or all, their name. Finally, using\nthe time series of the word frequency of people\u2019s name, we compare the fame of individuals born in the\nsame year or having the same occupation.\n\nIII.7A) Complete procedure\n\n7.A.1 - Extraction of individuals appearing in Wikipedia.\n\nWikipedia is a large encyclopedic information source, with an important number of articles referring to\npeople. We identify biographical Wikipedia articles through the DBPedia engine (Ref S9), a relational\ndatabase created by extensively parsing Wikipedia. For our purposes, the most relevant component of\nDBPedia is the \u201cCategories\u201d relational database.\n\nWikipedia categories are structural entities which unite articles related to a specific topic. The DBPedia\n\u201cCategories\u201d database includes, for all articles within Wikipedia, a complete listing of the categories of\nwhich this article is a member. As an example, the article for Albert Einstein\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is a member of 73 categories, including \u201cGerman physicists\u201d,\n\u201cAmerican physicists\u201d, \u201cViolonists\u201d, \u201cPeople from Ulm\u201d and \u201c1879_births\u201d.

Create fame cohorts for individuals with the same occupation.\ni. Use most famous 20\" year, ranking on the basis of the 20\" best year in the\nterms of fame for the individual.\n\nIII.7B. Cohorts of fame\n\nFor each year, we defined a cohort of the top 50 most famous individuals born that year. Individual fame\nwas measured in this case by the average frequency over all years after one's birth. We can compute\ncohorts on the basis of names from Wikipedia, or Encyclopedia Britannica. In Figure 5, we used cohorts\ncomputed with names from Wikipedia.\n\nAt each time point, we defined the frequency of the cohort as the median value of the frequencies of all\nindividuals in the cohort.\n\nFor each cohort, we define:\n\n(1) Age of initial celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 10-9. This\ncorresponds to the point at which the median individual in the cohort enter the \"English lexicon\" as\ndefined in the first section of the paper.\n\n(2) Age of peak celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 95% of its peak\nvalue. This definition is meant to diminish the noise that exists on the exact position of the peak value of\nthe cohort's frequency.\n\n(3) Doubling time of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame increases between the \u2018age of\nfame' and the 'age of peak fame\u2019. To do so, we fit an exponential to the timeseries with the methods of\nleast squares. The doubling time is derived from the estimated exponent.\n\n(4) Half-life of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame decreases past the year at which it\nreaches its peak (which is later than the \"age of peak celebrity\" as defined above). To do so, we fit an\nexponential to the timeseries with the methods of least squares. The half-life is derived from the\nestimated exponent.\n\nWe show the way these parameters change with the cohort\u2019s year of birth in Figure $13.\n\nThe dynamics of these quantities is sensibly the same when using cohorts from Wikipedia or from\nEncyclopedia Britannica. However, Britannica features fewer individuals in their cohorts, and therefore the\ncohorts from the early 19\" century are much noisier. We show in Figure $14 the fame analysis\nconducted with cohorts from Britannica, restricting our analysis to the years 1840-1950.\n\nIn Figure 5E, we analyze the trade-offs between early celebrity and overall fame as a function of\noccupation. For each occupation, we select the top 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and\n1920. For each occupation, we define the contour within which all points are close to at least 2 member of\nthe cohort (it is the contour of the density map created by the cohort).\n\n25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017033\n", "sample": "l11.7.A.10 \u2014 Compare the fame of multiple individuals.\n\nHaving identified the best name candidate for every individual, we use the word frequency time series of\nthis name as a metric for the fame of t", "file_stem": "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017033.jpg"}, {"file": "../data/images/IMAGES-20251113T140642Z-1-019/IMAGES/004/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016477.jpg", "text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\nAPPELLATE DIVISION: FIRST DEPARTMENT\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,\nRespondent,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nAFFIRMATION IN RESPONSE TO NON-PARTY MOTION\nN.Y.

Underenforcement Against Corruption\n\nCrimes of corruption by state and local officials are a good example of harms that, at times, criminal justice systems have\nunduly ignored. 34 Local police and prosecutors are not institutionally well-situated to pursue and evaluate those crimes. They\noften have professional, if not personal, ties to other local officials, which heightens the risk of undue favoritism or judgments\nthat are otherwise not fully disinterested. That is the main reason [*855] that federal investigators and prosecutors have state\n\nand local corruption in their portfolios. *\u00b0\n\n2. Underenforcement Against Sexual Assault\n\nSexual assault offenses are another context in which underenforcement is now widely recognized, but the causes are different.\n\nRather than favoritism toward offenders, the problem seems to be bias against the type of offense, and, in varying degrees,\nagainst the victims. Failures of police to rigorously pursue allegations of sexual assaults have been widely documented. %\u00b0\nAmong the explanations that advocates, attorneys and some scholars point to are \"the entrenched nature of long-recognized,\ngender-driven biases by police against domestic violence or sexual assault claims\" and \"against individuals from particular\ngroups or under particular circumstances,\" especially against victims who are poor or are racial, ethnic or gender minorities. 37\nOne large-scale empirical study of why rape-kit evidence remained untested, for example, suggested that the explanation in part\nwas \"negative beliefs and stereotypes about victims, which adversely affected the quality of the investigation.\" 3\u00b0 It bears\nnoting that much of this bias is understood to be subtle or unconscious patterns built on cultural norms, rather than conscious,\npurposeful disfavor. 3? But when evidentiary records are incomplete or ambiguous, their effects are substantial.\n\n[*856]\n3. Underenforcement Against Police Excessive Uses of Force\n\nFailures to prosecute in the wake of police shootings and other possibly excessive uses of force against civilians are scenarios\nthat raise suspicions of both bias against victims, many of whom are black men (and often criminal suspects, another disfavored\n\nvictims and defendants\"); Natapoff, supra note 28, at 1753; David Alan Sklansky, Police and Democracy, /03 Mich.

Verb frequencies\n\nNext, for each verb, we computed the frequency of the regular past tense (built by suffixation of \u2018-ed\u2019 at\nthe end of the verb), and the frequency of the irregular past tense (summing preterit and past participle).\nThese trajectories are represented in Fig 3A and Fig S8.\n\nWe define the regularity of a verb: at any given point in time, the regularity of a verb is the percentage of\npast tense usage made using the regular version. Therefore, in a given year, the regularity of a verb is\nr=R/(R+l) where R is the number of times the regular past tense was used, and | the number of times the\nirregular past tense was used. The regularity is a continuous variable that ranges between 0 and 1\n(100%).\n\nWe plot in Figure 3B the mean regularity between 1800-1825 in x-axis, and the mean regularity between\n1975-2000 in y-axis.\n\nIf we assume that a speaker of the English language uses only one of the two variants (regular or\nirregular); and that all speakers of English are equally likely to use the verb; then the regularity translates\ndirectly into percentage of the population of speakers using the regular form. While these assumptions\nmay not hold generally, they provide a convenient way of estimating the prevalence of a certain word in\nthe population of English speakers (or writers).\n\nIII.5C. Rates of regularization\n\nWe can compute, for any verb, the slope of regularity as a function of time: this can be interpreted as the\nvariation in percentage of the population of English speakers using the regular form.\n\nBy holding population size constant over the time window used to obtain the slope, we derive the\nvariation of population using the regular form in absolute terms.\n\nFor instance, the regularity of \u201csneak/snuck\u201d has decreased from 100% to 50% over the past 50 years,\nwhich is 1% per year. We consider the population of US English speakers to be roughly 300 million. As a\nresult, snuck is sneaking in at a speed of 3 million speakers per year, or about one speaker per minute in\nthe US.\n\nIII.5D. Classification of Verbs\n\nThe verbs were classified into different types based on the phonetic pattern they represented using the\nclassification of Ref 18 (main text). Fig 3C shows the median regularity for the verbs \u2018burn\u2019, \u2018spoil\u2019, \u2018dwell\u2019,\n\u2018learn\u2019, \u2018smell\u2019, \u2018spill\u2019 in each year.

Estimation of Lexicon Size\n\nHow frequent does a 1-gram have to be in order to be considered a word? We chose a minimum\nfrequency threshold for \u2018common\u2019 1-grams by attempting to identify the largest frequency decile that\nremains lower than the frequency of most dictionary words.\n\nWe plotted a histogram showing the frequency of the 1-grams defined in AHD4, as measured in our year\n2000 lexicon. We found that 90% of 1-gram headwords had a frequency greater than 10\u00b0, but only 70%\nwere more frequent than 10\u00b0. Therefore, the frequency 10\u00b0 is a reasonable threshold for inclusion in the\nlexicon.\n\nTo estimate the number of words, we began by generating the list of common 1-grams with a higher\nchronological resolution, namely 11 different time points from 1900 until 2000 (1900, 1910, 1920, ... 2000)\nas described above. We next excluded all 1-grams with non-alphabetical characters in order to produce a\nlist of common alphabetical forms for each time point.\n\nFor three of the time points (1900, 1950, 2000), we took a random sample of 1000 alphabetical forms\nfrom the resulting set of alphabetical forms. These were classified by a native English speaker with no\nknowledge of the analyses being performed. The results of the classification are found in Appendix. We\nasked the speaker to classify the candidate words were classified into 8 categories:\n\nM if the word is a misspelling or a typo or seems like gibberish*\n\nN if the word derives primarily from a personal or a company name\n\nP for any other kind of proper nouns\n\nH if the word has lost its original hyphen\n\nF if the word is a foreign word not generally used in English sentences\n\nB if it is a \u2018borrowed\u2019 foreign word that is often used in English sentences\nR for anything that does not fall into the above categories\n\nU unclassifiable for some reason\n\nWe computed the fraction of these 1000 words at each time point that were classified as P, N, B, or R,\nwhich we call the \u2018word fraction for year X\u2019, or WFy. To compute the estimated lexicon size for 1900,\n1950, and 2000, we multiplied the word fraction by the number of alphabetical forms in those years.\n\nFor the other 8 time points, we did not perform a separate sampling step. Instead, we estimated the word\nfraction by linearly interpolating the word fraction of the nearest sampled time points; i.e., the word\nfraction in 1920 satisfied WF 4920=. WF 1909+ .4* (WF 1950.- WF 1900). We then multiplied the word fraction by the\nnumber of alphabetical forms in the corresponding year, as above.\n\nFor the year 2000 lexicon, we repeated the sampling and annotation process using a different native\nspeaker. The results were similar, which confirmed that our findings were independent of the person\ndoing the annotation.\n\nWe note that the trends shown in Fig 2A are similar when proper nouns (N) are excluded from the lexicon\n(i.e., the only categories are P, B and R). Figure S7 shows the estimates of the lexicon excluding the\ncategory \u2018N\u2019 (proper nouns).\n\n* A typo is a one-time typing error by someone who presumably Knows the correct spelling (as in\nimprotant); a misspelling, which generally has the same pronunciation as the correct spelling, arises when\na person is ignorant of the correct spelling (as in abberation).\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017024\n", "sample": "(c) Oxford English Dictionary (Reference in main text)\n\nFrom the website of the OED we can read that the \u201cnumber of word forms defined and/or illustrated\u201d is\n615,100; and that we find 169,000 \u201citalici", "file_stem": "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017024.jpg"}, {"file": "../data/images/IMAGES-20251113T140642Z-1-019/IMAGES/004/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017018.jpg", "text": "II.3B. Generation of historical n-grams corpora\n\nTo generate a particular historical n-grams corpus, a subset of book editions is chosen to serve as the\nbase corpus. The chosen editions are divided by publication year. For each publication year, total counts\nfor each n-gram are obtained by summing n-gram counts for each book edition that was published in that\nyear. In particular, three counts are generated: (1) the total number of times the n-gram appears; (2) the\nnumber of pages on which the n-gram appears; and (3) the number of books in which the n-gram\nappears.\n\nWe then generate tables showing all three counts for each n-gram, resolved by year. In order to ensure\nthat n-grams could not be easily used to identify individual text sources, we did not report counts for any\nn-grams that appeared fewer than 40 times in the corpus. (As a point of reference, the total number of 1-\ngrams that appear in the 3.2 million books written in English with highest date accuracy (\u2018eng-all\u2019, see\nbelow) is 360 billion: a 1-gram that would appear fewer than 40 times occurs at a frequency of the order\nof 10\u00b0 ') As a result, rare spelling and OCR errors were also omitted. Since most n-grams are infrequent,\nthis also served to dramatically reduce the size of the n-gram tables. Of course, the most robust historical\ntrends are associated with frequent n-grams, so our ability to discern these trends was not compromised\nby this approach.\n\nBy dividing the reported counts by the corpus size (measured in either words, pages, or books), it is\npossible to determine the normalized frequency with which an n-gram appears in the base corpus. Note\nthat the different counts can be used for different purposes. The usage frequency of an n-gram,\nnormalized by the total number of words, reflects both the number of authors using an n-gram, and how\nfrequently they use it. It can be driven upward markedly by a single author who uses an n-gram very\nfrequently, for instance in a biography of 'Gottlieb Daimler' which mentions his name many times. This\nlatter effect is sometimes undesirable. In such cases, it may be preferable to examine the fraction of\nbooks containing a particular n-gram: texts in different books, which are usually written by different\nauthors, tend to be more independent.\n\nEleven corpora were generated, based on eleven different subsets of books. Five of these are English\nlanguage corpora, and six are foreign language corpora.\n\nEng-all\n\nThis is derived from a base corpus containing all English language books which pass the filters described\nin section 1.\n\nEng-1M\n\nThis is derived from a base corpus containing 1 million English language books which passed the filters\ndescribed in section 1. The base corpus is a subset of the Eng-all base corpus.\n\nThe sampling was constrained in two ways.\n\nFirst, the texts were re-sampled so as to exhibit a representative subject distribution. Because digitization\ndepends on the availability of the physical books (from libraries or publishers), we reasoned that digitized\nbooks may be a biased subset of books as a whole. We therefore re-sampled books so as to ensure that\nthe diversity of book editions included in the corpus for a given year, as reflected by BISAC subject\ncodes, reflected the diversity of book editions actually published in that year. We estimated the latter\nusing our metadata database, which reflects the aggregate of our 100 bibliographic sources and includes\n10-fold more book editions than the scanned collection.\n\nSecond, the total number of books drawn from any given year was capped at 6174. This has the net\neffect of ensuring that the total number of books in the corpus is uniform starting around the year 1883.\nThis was done to ensure that all books passing the quality filters were included in earlier years.

Both options have some capacity to\nchallenge prosecutorial judgments affected by political or personal biases, institutional allegiances (especially between police\nand local politicians), or other illicit sources of favor or disfavor.

Review procedures enable judges and supervisory [*884] officials to do much the same thing, without the\ncost barriers for victims posed by private prosecutions. (Although it may well be that poorer victims are less likely even to\npetition for review, especially if they lack legal counsel to press their review requests.)\n\nWhy, then, have U.S. jurisdictions so uniformly rejected both options? As noted, both racial politics and the power of common\nlaw tradition are probable contributing reasons. '3\u00b0 Another is the singular choice of most state justice systems to make\nprosecutors locally elected officials, which does much to prevent kinds of over-and underenforcement disfavored by local\nmajorities. That, in turn, likely reduces pressure for reforms that would improve other safeguards against decisions not to\nprosecute - especially decisions that cut against popular local preferences, which in many communities include rigorous\n\n2016) (authorizing victims dissatisfied with public prosecutor to petition the court and granting courts the power to allow victim's attorney to\ntake over as private prosecutor).\n\n87 See 12 RL.

Key facts are often disputed, and while federal\nand state jurisdiction are coextensive here, federal criminal law generally sets a higher bar for liability than state law, especially\ndue to its more onerous mens rea requirement. 7? That makes the former an imperfect backstop to the latter, because they are\nonly partially redundant. And as recent changes in federal policy suggest, 74 redundancy between governments is subject to\npolitical shifts in those governments; federal oversight of state enforcement works only if federal officials are committed to the\noversight role. Moreover, keeping prosecution in the exclusive province of executive officials keeps prosecutorial discretion\nmore closely aligned with political majorities and thereby with popular sentiments about certain groups of defendants (such as\npolice officers) and victim groups (such as criminal suspects).

Federal prosecutors lack authority over most assaults that do not involve public officials or\nfederal [*852] property. Sexual assaults are one context in which the enforcement strategies favored in Europe and England -\nregulated private prosecution or review of declination decisions - hold more promise.\n\nI. UNDERENFORCEMENT AND REASONS NOT TO PROSECUTE\nA. Sources of Unyustified Noncharging Decisions\n\nPublic prosecutors are the gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement, and justice systems employ a variety of safeguards against\nprosecutors\u2019 misjudgment, bias, incompetence, or laziness. Most are directed at prosecutors\u2019 charging decisions rather than\ndecisions declining to charge (i.c., declination decisions), for familiar reasons - charging creates real burdens and risks for\ndefendants. *\u00b0 Many familiar procedural components are aimed at preventing improper criminal charges or the harm they can\ncause. Requirements that charges are based on sufficient evidence are an obvious example, but double jeopardy laws and\nrestrictions on prosecutors\u2019 conflicts of interest serve the same purpose. The full range of pretrial and trial procedures designed\nto assure accurate and unbiased adjudication are intended to sort out improper charges and attach punishments only to proper\nones. 7\u00b0\n\nSafeguards against nonenforcement, or unjustified decisions not to prosecute, are fewer, are less explicit, and (in common law\njurisdictions) are less often in the form of legal rules and mandates. One explanation for this is simply that the interests at stake\nare not as high - no individual faces prosecution and possible punishment. Another is that many non-prosecution decisions\n\n23 Police violence is often prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 (2012) (criminalizing the deprivation of rights under color of law).

For one, it does not follow from the fact that officials must assess evidentiary sufficiency that\ntheir assessments should be unregulated or unsupervised. The tradition in civil law jurisdictions is otherwise, and available\nevidence often depends on the effort and priority officials give to finding it. More importantly, how rigorously we guard against\nunmerited nonenforcement depends on how we value the interests harmed by nonenforcement, and on how much we worry\nabout nonenforcement for the wrong reasons. Both have changed over time.\n\nThe primary causes of underenforcement are failing to investigate and charge due to biases against certain victims or harms, or\nfavoritism toward certain kinds of suspects. 7\u00b0 Three kinds of crimes - local government corruption, sexual assaults, and\nunjustified uses of force by law enforcement officers - illustrate the link between these risks, failures to enforce, and the\n\nconsequences of underenforcement. Local corruption garners the least public and political attention now; 7\u00b0\n\nnot coincidentally,\nthe United States has found an effective model of enforcement redundancy on this front. 7\u00b0 The justice system's responses to\nsexual assault and police violence, on the other hand, are subjects of heated political and policy debates. 7! There has been\nnotable progress in reducing the criminal justice system's disregard of [*854] both kinds of offenses, but underenforcement -\nand almost as important, widespread suspicion of underenforcement - remain significant enough that they illustrate some of the\nkey costs of those failures. Suspicion of underenforcement is itself a cost, because it reflects a loss of legitimacy for criminal\njustice institutions. That loss in turn undermines the system's efficacy if citizens decline to report victimization or otherwise\ndecline to cooperate with law enforcement officials. Evidence for those effects is strong for both sexual assaults and police\nviolence. 37 More generally, underenforcement is a form of unequal treatment that unevenly - and unjustly - distributes the\nimportant public benefits of criminal law enforcement, including the state's commitment to protect everyone equally from\nunlawful harms. +? It also deprives victims of the private benefits that criminal justice is now widely recognized to afford, and\nowe, to victims.\n\n27 See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 727-28 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Law enforcement is not automatic ... .

Finally, another institution responds to some of the same underenforcement\nproblems that private prosecution and judicial review could address - redundant prosecution authority in a federal system.\n\nC. Federalism Safeguards on Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nThe scope of the U.S. federal crimmal code expanded vastly in the twentieth century, as did the federal government's\ninstitutional capacity to enforce that code and its regulatory authority more generally. The result has been a distinctive form of\ncriminal justice federalism: federal enforcement authority wholly overlaps the territorial scope of state criminal law, and the\nfederal code substantially overlaps much of what is covered in state criminal codes. The resulting structure of redundant\nfederal-state authority has evolved into a means - unusual even among federal nation-states - to second-guess and effectively\ntrump state prosecutors\u2019 declination decisions without empowering courts or private parties.\n\nNo other nation built on a federal model incorporates nearly [*885] the same degree of redundancy between state and federal\njustice systems. !3! The more common model of criminal justice federalism is found in Canada and Germany: each has a\nsingle national criminal code that is administered by separate state-level prosecution agencies and court systems. !3? Other\nfederal states follow the U.S. model and have separate criminal codes, prosecution agencies, and court systems in each state as\nwell as for the federal government. Australia follows this model, but the scope and jurisdiction of Australian federal criminal\nlaw is much more limited than is U.S. federal law; federal crimes are largely confined to offenses that implicate distinct federal\ninterests - it is probably closer to U.S. federal criminal law in 1910 than 2010. The result is that in Australia federal criminal\nlaw enforcement overlaps much less with state criminal law. !73\n\nThe broad redundancy provided by U.S. federalism enables federal prosecutors to serve as checks on underenforcement by\nstate prosecutors, at least for some large and important categories [*886] of crime. In effect, federal prosecutors can review\nthe declination decisions of state prosecutors - as well as the adequacy and success of their prosecutions - and then decide\nwhether to file federal charges in cases that their state counterparts declined to pursue, charged too leniently, or in which they\nfailed to win a conviction or sufficiently harsh sanctions. (In theory state prosecutors conduct the same oversight over much of\n\n\u00b0\u00b0 See George Fisher, The Jury's Rise as Lie Detector, 107 Yale L.J. 575, 671-96 (1997) (discussing the impact of racial policies in post-Civil\nWar jury and court processes).\n\n\u00b06 Tam aware of no historical research on African American private prosecutors, and I have found no evidence of any in case law or general\naccounts of private prosecutions.\n\n%7 See, e.g., Fisher, supra note 95, at 684 n.514 (\"Denial to the freedman of the power to testify in court against the white man ... strikes not\nat a mere civil franchise, but at a natural right - the right of protecting life and property.

The samples contained 500 candidate, words each lor all but the\ntop 3 deciles; the samples corresponding to the top 3 deciles (10\u00b0 - 10%, 10*- 10\u00b0, 10\u00b0- 10\u00b0 2)\ncontained 100 candidate words each.\n\nA native speaker with no knowledge of the experiment being performed determined which words from our\nrandom samples fell into the P, B, or R categories (to enable a fair comparison, we excluded the N\ncategory from our analysis as both OED an MW exclude them). The annotator then attempted to find a\ndefinition for the words in both the online edition of the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary or in the\nonline version of the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s 2\u2122 edition. Notably, the performance of the latter was\nboosted appreciably by its inclusion of Merriam-Webster\u2019s Medical Dictionary. Results of this analysis are\nshown in Appendix.\n\nTo estimate the fraction of dark matter in the English language, we applied the formula:\nsum over all deciles of Pworg*Poepiw*Nigram, with:\n\n- Nigram the number of 1grams in the decile\n\n- Pworg the proportion of words (R,B or P) in this decile\n\n- Poepw the proportion of words of that decile that are covered in OED or MW.\n\nWe obtain 52% of dark matter, words not listed in either MW or the OED.

Analysis New and Obsolete words in the American Heritage\nDictionary\n\nWe obtained a list of the 4804 vocabulary items that were added to the AHD4 in 2000 from the\ndictionary\u2019s editorial staff. These 4804 words were not in AHD3 (1992) \u2014 although, on rare occasions a\nword could have featured in earlier editions of the dictionary (this is the case for \u201cgypseous\u201d, which was\nincluded in AHD1 and AHD2).\n\nSimilar to our study of the dictionary\u2019s lexicon, we restrict ourselves to 1grams. We find 2077 1-grams\nnewly added to the AHD4. Median frequency (Fig 2D) is computed by obtaining all frequencies of this set\nof words and computing its median.\n\nNext, we ask which 1grams appear in AHD4 but are not part of the year 2000 lexicon any more\n(frequency lower than one part per billion between 1990 and 2000).

The frequency of the name, which corresponds to a measure of how often\nan individual is mentioned, provides a metric for the fame of that person. We append the word\nfrequencies of all the names which can potentially refer to an individual.

The fame signal is the\ntimeseries of normalized word matches in the complete English database.\n\n11.7.A.7 \u2014 Find ambiguous names which can refer to multiple individuals.\n\nCertain names are particularly popular and are shared by multiple people. This results in ambiguity, as\nthe same query name may refer to a plurality of individuals. Homonimity conflicts occur between a group\nof individuals when they share some part of, or all, their name. When these homonimity conflicts arise,\nthe word frequency of a specific name may not reflect the number of references to a unique person, but to\nthat of an entire group. As such, the word frequency does not constitute a clear means of tracking the\nfame of the concerned individuals. We identify homonimity conflicts by finding instances of individuals\nwhose names contain complete or partial matches. These conflicts are, when possible, resolved on the\nbasis of the importance of the conflicted individuals in the following step. Typical homonimity conflicts are\nshown in Table $11.\n\n7) Identify homonimity conflicts. Homonimity conflicts arise when the query names of two or more\nindividuals contain a substring match. These conflicts are distinguished as such :\n\na. For every query name of every record, find the set of substrings of query names.\n\nb. For every query name of every record, search for matches in the set of query name\nsubstrings of all other records.\n\nc. Bidirectional homonimity conflicts occur when a query name fully matches another query\nname. The name conflicted name could be used to refer to both individuals.\nUnidirectional conflicts occur when a query name has a substring match within another\nquery name. Thus, the conflicted name can refer to one of the individuals, but also be\npart of a name referring to another.\n\nl11.7.A.8 \u2014 Resolve, when possible, the most likely origin of ambiguous names.\n\nThe problem of homonymous individuals is limiting because the word frequencies data do not allow us to\nresolve the true identity behind a homonymous name. Nonetheless, in some cases, it is possible to\ndistinguish conflicted individuals on the basis of their importance. For the database of people extracted\nfrom Encyclopedia Britannica, we argue that the quantity of information available about an individual\nprovides a proxy for their relevance. Likewise, for people obtained from Wikipedia, we can judge their\nimportance by the size of the article written about the person and the quantity of traffic the article\ngenerates. As such, we approach the problem of ambiguous names by comparing the notability of\nindividuals, as evaluated by the amount of information available about them in the respective\nencyclopedic source.

The first, Wikipedia Categories, was previously described and used to recognize articles\nabout people. Wikipedia Categories also contain information pertaining to occupation. The categories\n\u201cPhysicists\u201d, \u201cPhysicists by Nationality\u2019, \u201cPhysicists stubs\u201d, along with their subcategories, pinpoint articles\nof relating to the occupation of physicist. The second are Wikipedia Lists, special pages dedicated to\nlisting Wikipedia articles which fit a precise subject. For physicists, relevant examples are \u201cList of\nphysicists\u201d, \u201cList of plasma physicists\u201d and \u201cList of theoretical physicists\u201d. Given their redundancy, these\ntwo structural elements, when used in combination provide a strong means of identifying the occupation\nof an individual.\n\nNext, we selected the top 50 individuals in each category, and annotated each one manually as a function\nof the individual's main occupation, as determined by reading the associated Wikipedia article. For\ninstance, \u201cChe Guevara\u2019 was listed in Biologists; so even though he was a medical doctor by training, this\nis not his primary historical contribution. The most famous individuals of each category born between\n1800 and 1920 are given in Appendix.\n\nIn our database of individuals, we append, when available, information about the occupations of people.\nThis enables the comparison, on the basis of fame, of groups of individuals distinguished by their\noccupational decisions.\n\n2) Associate Wikipedia records of individuals with occupations using relevant Wikipedia\n\u201cCategories\u201d and \u201cLists\u201d pages.

As a point of comparison, 27 of 100 books (27%) selected at random from an\nunfiltered corpus contained date-of-publication errors of greater than 5 years. The unfiltered corpus was\ncreated using a sampling strategy similar to that of Eng-1M. This selection mechanism favored recent\nbooks (which are more frequent) and pre-1800 books, which were excluded in the sampling strategy for\nfiltered books; as such the two numbers (6.2% and 27%) give a sense of the improvement, but are not\nstrictly comparable.\n\nNote that since the base corpora were generated (August 2009), many additional improvements have\nbeen made to the metadata dates used in Google Book Search itself. As such, these numbers do not\nreflect the accuracy of the Google Book Search online tool.\n\nII.1B. OCR quality\n\nThe challenge of performing accurate OCR on the entire books dataset is compounded by variations in\nsuch factors as language, font, size, legibility, and physical condition of the book. OCR quality was\nassessed using an algorithm developed by Popat et al. (Ref S3). This algorithm yields a probability that\nexpresses the confidence that a given sequence of text generated by OCR is correct. Incorrect or\nanomalous text can result from gross imperfections in the scanned images, or as a result of markings or\ndrawings. This algorithm uses sophisticated statistics, a variant of the Partial by Partial Matching (PPM)\nmodel, to compute for each glyph (character) the probability that it is anomalous given other nearby\nglyphs. (\u2018Nearby' refers to 2-dimensional distance on the original scanned image, hence glyphs above,\nbelow, to the left, and to the right of the target glyph.) The model parameters are tuned using multi-\nlanguage subcorpora, one in each of the 32 supported languages. From the per-glyph probability one can\ncompute an aggregate probability for a sequence of glyphs, including the entire text of a volume. In this\nmanner, every volume has associated with it a probabilistic OCR quality score (quantized to an integer\nbetween 0-100; note that the OCR quality score should not be confused with character or word accuracy).\nIn addition to error detection, the Popat model is also capable of computing the probability that the text is\nin a particular language given any sequence of characters. Thus the algorithm serves the dual purpose of\ndetecting anomalous text while simultaneously identifying the language in which the text is written.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality data, we excluded volumes with poor OCR quality. For the languages that\nuse a Latin alphabet (English, French, Spanish, and German), the OCR quality is generally higher, and\nmore books are available. As a result, we filtered out all volumes whose quality score was lower than\n80%. For Chinese and Russian, fewer books were available, and we did not apply the OCR filter. For\nHebrew, a 50% threshold was used, because its OCR quality was relatively better than Chinese or\nRussian. For geographically specific corpora, English US and English UK, a less stringent 60% threshold\nwas used, in order to maximize the number of books included (note that, as such, these two corpora are\nnot strict subsets of the broader English corpus). Figure S4 shows the distribution of OCR quality score\nas a function of the fraction of books in the English corpus. Use of an 80% cut off will remove the books\nwith the worst OCR, while retaining the vast majority of the books in the original corpus.\n\nThe OCR quality scores were also used as a /ocalized indicator of textual quality in order to remove\nanomalous sections of otherwise high-quality texts. The end source text was ensured to be of\ncomparable quality to the post-OCR text presented in \"text-mode\" on the Google Books website.\n\nII.1C. Accuracy of language metadata\n\nWe applied additional filters to remove books with dubious language-of-composition metadata. This filter\nremoved volumes whose meta-data language tag disagrees with the language determined by the\nstatistical language detection algorithm described in section 2A. For our English corpus, 8.56%\n\n6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017014\n", "sample": "metadata dates that were more than 5 years from the date determined by a human examining the book.\nBecause errors are much more common among older books, and because the actual corpora are strongly\nbi", "file_stem": "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017014.jpg"}, {"file": "../data/images/IMAGES-20251113T140642Z-1-019/IMAGES/004/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017000.jpg", "text": "extreme, 1.5% of the population exhibited a dramatic rise\n(s>5).

Rev. 844, *873\n\ncorrelative rather than causal, but it nonetheless suggests a reason for why state justice systems took a different path from other\ncommon-law jurisdictions and abolished private charging. Local white majorities had little need for a structural check on\nprosecutors they elected, and they likely did not want a way for African-American citizens to challenge prosecutors and\nindependently pursue their interests in criminal courts. Prosecution redundancy would reduce the control of local majorities to\ndictate enforcement policies, including preferences for selective underenforcement.\n\nB. Judicial and Administrative Review of Decisions Not to Charge\n\nA second structure that creates some redundant authority over decisions not to prosecute exposes those prosecutorial decisions\nto review, either by courts or by supervising officials within an administrative hierarchy. As with private prosecution, this\nmechanism is almost nonexistent among U.S. jurisdictions, with the significant exception of federal law. But this option has\ngained ground elsewhere, in England and throughout E.U. countries. In all these contexts, its adoption responds to demands for\nexpanded victims\u2019 rights in the criminal process. This Section briefly surveys prominent examples of noncharging review in\nfederal law and Europe, then considers why state justice systems uniformly reject it.\n\n[*874]\n1. Oversight of Declination Decisions in Europe\n\nPursuant to an E.U. Directive, !\u00b0\u00b0 twenty-five of the twenty-eight member states of the European Union grant crime victims\nformal rights to seek review of decisions not to file criminal charges based on their complaints. '\u00b0! The details of these review\nprocedures vary. Some authorize judicial review of prosecutors\u2019 decisions; most jurisdictions, including Scotland and France,\nprovide at least a means for review by independent officials within the prosecution agency, perhaps with an additional\n\npossibility for judicial review. !\u00b0* Although E.U. nations with common law-based legal systems, such as Ireland, Northern\n\n103\n\nIreland, and England, have adopted versions of this practice, the [*875] practice is more established in civil law\n\njurisdictions, likely because it is consistent with the longstanding duty in some civil law countries of mandatory prosecution.\n104\n\nProsecutions Vict., Annual Report 14-15, at 86, http://www. opp.vic.gov.au/getattachment/Shc2fefc-8715-4516-9fb8-\n57ea3e4b6342/OPP_Annual Report_]4_15 Full_web .aspx (noting that pursuant to discretion granted under \u00a7 22(b)(ii), the DPP took over\nand dismissed one private prosecution instituted for an \"improper purpose\").

The constitutional double jeopardy doctrine since at least 1922 has recognized the\n\"dual sovereignty\" of state and federal governments. Notwithstanding the guarantee that no person shall \"be subject for the\nsame offence to be twice put in jeopardy,\" the Double Jeopardy Clause has been understood not to preclude federal prosecutors'\npower to charge a person who has previously been prosecuted by state officials for the same criminal conduct, and federal\nprosecutions likewise do not limit subsequent state enforcement efforts. !5\u00b0 By granting certiorari in United States v. Gamble\n\n136\n\nthis term, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to revisit this doctrine, which provides the foundation for the federalism-based\n\ncheck on underenforcement.\n\nFederal prosecutors do not attempt to keep an eye on all state prosecution decisions and practices, and federal criminal [*887]\nlaw is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; significant gaps are discussed in the next Part. But the substantive\nredundancy is considerable. For some areas of dual authority - such as drug crimes, fraud, child pornography, and human\ntrafficking - federal and state agencies often coordinate investigative efforts and divide up prosecution responsibilities. But\nfederal Justice Department policy to exercise oversight of state enforcement practices in certain categories of crime is\ndeliberate and formalized. Notable examples include state and local government corruption, excessive use of force and other\nwrongdoing by police, and other criminal civil rights violations. 137 Especially in these areas, federal prosecutors assess\nwhether to file their own charges in cases in which their state counterparts declined to charge, charged too leniently, or in\nwhich they failed to win appropriate convictions. Federal prosecution in the wake of state declination is hardly the norm - it\n\nshould not be, if state prosecutors decline cases for the right reasons !38\n\n139\n\n- but federal officials do remedy meaningful\nenforcement gaps left by state prosecutors.\n\nFunctionally, this inter-governmental model of review resembles intra-agency administrative review with greater independence\nbetween initial decision makers and subsequent reviewers. Oversight of state prosecutors rests with the policy [*888]\npriorities of federal executive branch officials.

Other Contributions to Underenforcement\n\nIt is worth noting that prosecutors themselves might not share those biases so much as take account of them in a local\ncommunity and jury pool. Expecting juries will be unreceptive to a case is one reason that some prosecutors cite for not\ncharging in some cases. There is evidence for this with regard to hate [*859] crimes against LGBT victim groups, for\n\nexample, *!\n\nand the difficulty prosecutors have faced in convicting police officer defendants is a well-recognized hurdle in\npolice violence cases. *\u201d The same considerations can cut against prosecutions when victims are undocumented immigrants,\nsex workers, prisoners, and suspects in custody. >? Redundant enforcement authority can do less to redress this barrier,\nalthough depending on its form, it is not powerless. A separate prosecuting authority might bring better investigation and fact\n\ndevelopment, or different jurisdictional rules that change the composition of jury venires. ~4\n\nInadequate funding for criminal justice agencies can also play a role in aggravating areas of unjustified underenforcement.\nLack of public resources is an accepted (and inevitable) justification for declining to prosecute in some cases where evidence is\nsufficient to prove guilt. \u00b0\u00b0 But funding constraints are [*860] not an affirmative good on par with other policy-based, public-\ninterest justifications for non-prosecution, such as judgments finding that civil, regulatory, or public-health remedies are\npreferable to criminal sanctions, or concluding that third-party harms outweigh prosecution's benefits. *\u00b0 Resource constraints\nare a problem justice systems would like to minimize. Two of the three primary forms of enforcement redundancy do exactly\nthat, or have in the past. Expanding federal law enforcement jurisdiction over crimes already within state jurisdiction was\ndesigned to bring federal resources to bear on crimes where state resources were insufficient. >\u2019 And private prosecution,\nwhere it [*861] still exists, has an equivalent effect - it permits victims to contribute private funds to public enforcement\nefforts. It is no coincidence that common law jurisdictions relied on private prosecution most heavily - through the mid-\nnineteenth century - when state capacity, including criminal justice infrastructure, was much thinner. *\u00ae\n\n4 See, e.g., Paul D.

That is especially\nso with crimes in which evidence development is more costly, so officials have to decide whether to invest scarce resources in\nthose that require substantial investigative efforts. Both sexual assault and police violence cases often require larger-scale\ninvestments to develop evidence sufficient for prosecution. Failures to make those investments are common reasons for non-\n\nprosecution in both contexts. >?\n\nIl. MECHANISMS OF PROSECUTORIAL ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nFor a range of reasons and across a range of contexts, public prosecutors\u2019 failures to enforce criminal law have been of\nsufficient concern to lead contemporary justice systems to devise checks against unjustified underenforcement. Approaches\ntake three basic forms: (1) limited authority for private parties to initiate or participate in criminal prosecutions; (2) independent\nreview of initial non-prosecution decisions, upon petition from a [*862] victim; and (3) multiple, mdependent public\nprosecution agencies with independent authority to bring charges for the same wrongdoing. Outside the United States, the first\ntwo options predominate; their expansion in recent years is a direct consequence of broader reforms to expand crime victims'\nrights. \u00b0\u00b0 U.S. jurisdictions, however, rely almost wholly on the third model. Despite having adopted otherwise expansive\nvictims\u2019 rights laws in recent decades in response to an influential movement for crime victims' rights, state and federal laws\nconsistently and explicitly avoid granting any formal authority to private parties, or courts, over criminal charging. The next\nthree Sections provide an overview of these options, where they exist. Largely with regard to U.S. policy choices only, they\nalso suggest reasons that one model prevailed over others.\n\nA. Victim Rights and Private Versus Public Interests\n\nIn the wake of victims\u2019 rights movements in North America and Europe, crime victims now have an array of legal nights once\ncriminal charges are filed. Victims in the U.S. and European jurisdictions now commonly have rights to participate that include\nrights to consult with prosecutors, to be notified of and present at court proceedings, and to offer statements at stages such as\nhearings on bail, sentencing, and parole. \u00a9!\n\n48 See Daniel Duane, Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?, N.Y.

In the contexts Eisenberg describes, prosecutors\ntypically forgo hate-crime offenses in favor of other charges rather than declining to prosecute altogether. Though the focus here is on\nprosecutors, they may not be the key cause of underenforcement. For similar reasons, police may not investigate or arrest in such cases, or if\nthey do prosecution can be undermined by lax evidence-gathering. Police practices are the focus on much of the scholarship on\nunderenforcement of certain offenses. Much of the literature on inadequate enforcement of sexual assault crimes focuses on weaknesses in\nthe police rather than prosecutors.

Nonetheless, this federalism-based model of\nprosecutorial oversight has an advantage shared by the administrative review schemes within single prosecution agencies. In\nboth settings, those with review power are prosecutors who should have greater institutional competence and legitimacy to\nsecond-guess other prosecutors\u2019 charging decisions, and consequently less inclination than courts to defer to prosecutorial\njudgments.\n\nThis federalist model of enforcement redundancy did not evolve from earlier common law institutional arrangements, like\nprivate prosecution, nor from the modern victims\u2019 rights movement, like judicial and administrative review of decisions not to\nprosecute. Federal criminal law enforcement expanded for several reasons, but behind many of those reasons is a common\npurpose: to remedy glaring patterns of underenforcement by the states. For example, federal law and institutional capacity\n(such as the advent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) expanded in response to states\u2019 inability to confront adequately the\nrise of interstate violence and drug crimes (as well as, for a time, prohibition on alcohol manufacture and distribution). !47\nFederal law [*889] took on the primary role in combatting local government corruption - including police corruption and\nexcessive uses of force - which local prosecution agencies often lacked the ability, or political independence, to confront. 7\nAnd federal law has long attempted to fill the gap when racially biased local police, prosecutors, and juries declined to arrest,\n\nprosecute, or convict suspects - especially white ones - who victimized black citizens. !44 In sum, the redundant enforcement\n\n104 Strafprozebetaordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], \u00a7\u00a7152, 160, 170, translation at /Attps://www.gesetze-im-\ninternet.de/englisch_ stpo/englisch_stpo-html (Ger.)

Table $1 lists the fraction removed at\nthis stage for our other non-English corpora.\n\nI1.1D. Year Restriction\n\nIn order to further ensure publication date accuracy and consistency of dates across all our corpora, we\nimplemented a publication year restriction and only retained books with publication years starting from\n1550 and ending in 2008. We found that a significant fraction of mis-dated books have a publication year\nof 0 or dates prior to the invention of printing. The number of books filtered due to this year range\nrestriction is considerably small, usually under 2% of the original number of books.\n\nThe fraction of the corpus removed by all stages of the filtering is summarized in Table $1. Note that\nbecause the filters are applied in a fixed order, the statistics presented below are influenced by the\nsequence in which the filters were applied. For example, books that trigger both the OCR quality filter and\nby the language correction filter are excluded by the OCR quality filter, which is performed first. Of course,\nthe actual subset of books filtered is the same regardless of the order in which the filters are applied.\n\nI].2. Metadata based subdivision of the Google Books Collection\n\nII].2A. Determination of language\n\nTo create accurate corpora in particular languages that minimize cross-language contamination, it is\nimportant to be able to accurately associate books with the language in which they were written. To\ndetermine the language in which a text is written, we rely on metadata derived from our 100 bibliographic\nsources, as well as statistical language determination using the Popat algorithm (Ref $3). The algorithm\ntakes advantage of the fact that certain character sequences, such as \u2018the\u2019, 'of, and \u2018ion\", occur more\nfrequently in English. In contrast, the sequences '\u2018la', 'aux', and 'de\u2019 occur more frequently in French.\nThese patterns can be used to distinguish between books written in English and those written in\nFrench. More generally, given the entire text of a book, the algorithm can reliably classify the book into\none of the 32 supported language types. The final consensus language was determined based on the\nmetadata sources as well as the results of the statistical language determination algorithm, with the\nstatistical algorithm as the higher priority.\n\nII.2B. Determination of book subject assignments\n\nBook subject assignments were determined using a book's Book Industry Standards and Communication\n(BISAC) subject categories. BISAC subject headings are a system for categorizing books based on\ncontent developed by the BISAC subject codes committee overseen by the Book Industry Study Group.\nThey are often used for a variety of purposes, such as to determine how books are shelved in stores. For\nEnglish, 92.4% of the books had at least one BISAC subject assignment. In cases where there were\nmultiple subject assignments, we took the more commonly used subject heading and discarded the rest.\n\nII.2C. Determination of book country-of-publication\n\nCountry of publication was determined on the basis of our 100 bibliographic sources; 97% of the books\nhad a country-of-publication assignment. The country code used is the 2 letter code as defined in the /SO\n3166-1 alpha-2 standard. More specifically, when constructing our US versus British English corpora, we\nused the codes \"us\" (United States) and \"gb\" (Great Britain) to filter our volumes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017015\n", "sample": "(approximately 235,000) of the books were filtered out in this way.

Associate the records of these articles with the occupation.\n\nl11.7.A.3 - Extraction of individuals appearing in Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica is a hand-curated, high quality encyclopedic dataset with many detailed\nbiographical entries. We obtained, in a private communication, structured datasets from Encyclopedia\nBritannica Inc. These datasets contain a complete record of all entries relating to individuals in the\nEncyclopedia Britannica. Each record contains the birth and death of the person at hand, as well as set of\ninformation snippets summarizing the most critical biographical information available within the\nencyclopedia.\n\nFor the analysis of fame, we extract, from the dataset provided by Encyclopedia Britannica Inc.,\nrecords of individuals born in between 1800 and 1980. For every person, we retain, as a measure of their\nnotability, a count of the number of biographical snippets present in the dataset. Figure $10b outlines the\nnumber of records parsed from the Encyclopedia Britannica dataset, as well as the number of these\nrecords ultimately retained for final analysis. Table S8 displays examples of records parsed in this step of\nthe analysis procedure.\n\n3) Create a database of records referring to people born 1800-1980 in Encyclopedia\nBritannica.\n\na.

Only people both in 1800-1980 are used\nfor the purposes of fame analysis. People born in 1700-1799 are used to identify naming\nambiguities as described in section III.7.A.7 of this Supplementary Material.\n\nb. For these entries, create a record identified by a unique integer containing the individual\u2019s\nfull name, as listed in the encyclopedia, and the individual's birth year.\n\nc.

Append this count to the record.\n\nl11.7.A.4 \u2014 Produce spelling variants of the full names of individuals.\n\nWe ultimately wish to identify the most relevant name used to commonly refer to an individual. Given the\nlimits of OCR and the specificities of the method used to create the word frequency database, certain\ntypographic elements such as accents, hyphens or quotation marks can complicate this process. As\nsuch, for every full name present in our database of people, we append variants of the full names where\nthese typographic elements have been removed or, when possible, replaced. Table S9 presents\nexamples of spelling variants for multiple names.\n\n4) In both databases, for every record, create a set of raw names variants. To create the set:\n\na. Include the original raw name.\n\nb. If the name includes apostrophes or quotation marks, include a variant where these\nelements are removed.\n\nc. If the first word in the name contains a hyphen, include a name where this hyphen is\nreplaced with a whitespace.\n\nd. lf the last word of the name is a numeral, include a name where this numeral has been\nremoved.\n\ne.

Epstein\u2019s Conviction for Sex Crimes and Designation as a Level Three Sex Offender\n\nIn June 2008, a Florida Court sentenced Jeffrey Epstein to eighteen months in prison after\nhe pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a fourteen-year-old girl. Affirmation of John M.\nBrowning dated December 21, 2018 (\u201cBrowning Aff.\u201d), Ex.

The New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders (\u201c\u201cNYBSO\u201d) recommended that\nEpstein be designated a level three sex offender \u2014 which is the level reserved for the most\ndangerous sexual predators \u2014 because investigators in Florida had found compelling evidence\nthat Epstein had abused scores of underage girls, despite only pleading guilty to solicitation of a\nsingle minor.

At the same time, the differences in how U.S.\ncriminal justice institutions have responded to underenforcement in each area highlight the efficacy and limits of the\nfederalism-based enforcement redundancy compared to the alternatives - both those U.S. jurisdictions reject (private\nprosecution and judicial review) and a fourth, unique strategy they embrace: politically accountable prosecutors.\n\n1. Public Corruption\n\nCorrupt conduct by government officials is a category of wrongdoing especially likely to suffer from underenforcement, for\nobvious reasons: we depend on one set of public officials, prosecutors and investigative agents, to stop wrongdoing by other\npublic officials - as well as by colleagues within their own ranks.

Decisions by U.S. courts give no special solicitude to instances of nonprosecution in the\nwake of injuries or deaths caused by prison guards or other law enforcement officials. See, e.g., Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 84, 85-87\n(1981) (rejecting state prison inmates! federal civil claim alleging bad faith by state officials to block issuance of arrest warrants against\nguards on allegations of unnecessary beatings during prison uprising); Jnmates of Attica Corr.

Oversight of Declination Decisions in State Justice Systems\n\nState justice systems do not go as far as the federal system does, much less provide the kind of oversight or victim recourse\nthat European systems now offer. And this is so despite the fact that all states have adopted substantial victims' bills of rights,\nnearly all of which include rights for victims to consult with prosecutors. Most make clear that the consultation right attaches\nonly after the prosecutor decides to file charges. !*\u00b0 Rights of administrative review are rare. !*! One reason for that is surely\nstructural. The U.S. Department of Justice is a hierarchically organized agency within which all federal prosecutors operate, a\nstructure that enables supervisory and quasi-independent review within the agency. But few states follow that model. Instead,\nprosecutors in most states are locally elected and operate [*881] autonomously from state justice departments or attorneys\ngeneral, which generally exercise little, if any, oversight. !?? Administrative review of state prosecutors! charging decisions is\nsimply not feasible without major reorganization of state justice systems.\n\nThat structural barrier probably explains why state prosecutors\u2019 decisions are functionally immune to administrative oversight,\nbut the lack of judicial oversight has a different origin. In accord with common law tradition, state and federal courts have\nnever meaningfully reviewed public prosecutors\u2019 noncharging decisions. !73 In particular, they have unambiguously rejected\nvictims' claims of standing to challenge those decisions. !*4 A few [*882] limited exceptions prove the rule. In cases of\nprivate criminal complaints filed by alleged victims, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania authorize judges to\nreview public prosecutors' decisions not to charge. !?> Even when statutes grant courts the power to review (or even mandate\nreview) of charging and dismissal decisions, state judges consistently have refused to scrutinize the merits of prosecutors'\njudgments. Many states have replaced the common law rule that gave prosecutors complete discretion to nolle prosequi (or\ndismiss) any criminal charge with statutes that require judges to confirm that non-prosecution is in the interest of justice. !*\u00b0\nYet courts uniformly refuse to engage in meaningful review, inferring instead that those statutes require deference to\n\nprosecutors. 12)\n\n84 See Erikson v.

Federal law grants victims a right to seek review of prosecutors' decisions within the Department\nof Justice hierarchy, although it also explicitly bars judicial review of Justice Department decisions in this process. !!4\nAlthough decision makers in an internal review process have less institutional independence from those they review than do\njudges engaged in judicial review, they also have a comparative advantage in institutional expertise, which could translate into\n\nless deference to, and more meaningful oversight of, front-line prosecutors.\n\nIn addition, federal law guarantees victims \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.\"\n\u201815 The Department of Justice interprets this not to create a right to confer before charges are filed, reasoning that no \"case\"\nexists until charges are filed. ''\u00ae Some lower courts have interpreted the statute differently, however, and concluded that it\n[*879] creates an enforceable right for victims to confer with prosecutors before, and about, the charging decision. One held\nthat prosecutors cannot enter a non-prosecution agreement with a suspect until they confer with victims, and that if they fail to\n\ndo so the court can order prosecutors to re-open the non-prosecution agreement. !!7 A few other lower federal courts have\n\nreached similar conclusions, !18 119\n\nalthough at least two have opposing conclusions.\nEven in its stronger form, this is a limited entitlement, in effect, to an opportunity to try to influence charging decisions. Even\nthe most aggressive federal courts on this point do not examine prosecutors\u2019 good faith during consultations or their reasons for\ndisagreeing with victims. In sum, neither the consultation right nor the right to review by Justice Department supervisors\ninfringes federal prosecutors\u2019 monopoly power over charging from judicial oversight.\n\nfor the court calendar). England had no full-scale prosecution agency until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution\nof Offences Act 1985. See Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, c. 23.

All are mechanisms to guard against unjustified nonenforcement,\nor underenforcement, by jurisdictions' primary prosecution agencies. The next Part examines the relative strengths of these\nalternatives.\n\nIll. PROS AND CONS OF FEDERALISM-BASED ENFORCEMENT REDUNDANCY\nA. Comparative Limits of Enforcement-Oversight Strategies\n\nEach of the institutional approaches to reducing underenforcement of criminal law by public prosecutors has comparative\nstrengths and weaknesses. All three share the common virtue of being a means to reduce instances of bias, favoritism, or other\nmisjudgments that result in unjustified nonenforcement. All three enable outside reevaluation of declination decisions. Private\nprosecution empowers motivated private parties - crime victims - to initiate the challenge to a public prosecutor's decision not\nto charge by filing charges themselves. The same is true in jurisdictions that subject declination decisions to formal\nadministrative or judicial review; victims trigger that process by petitioning for an independent evaluation. Both of those\npractices harness the motivations of interested private parties to, in effect, screen which declination decisions should be subject\nto reassessment, although private prosecution poses a significant cost barrier for victims who want to take advantage of it. At\nthe same time, both of these practices give public officials the final [*890] word on whether a prosecution (public or private)\nwill proceed.\n\nThe federalism route to prosecutorial oversight, by contrast, gives private parties no formal role, although victims can file\ncomplaints and lobby federal prosecutors just as they can with local police and prosecutors for any alleged crime. Put\ndifferently, federal prosecution as check on state underenforcement rests more directly on the mitiative, diligence, and\njudgment of federal prosecutors than private victims. In some areas, federal commitment is significant.

This final database contains bibliographic information for each of these\n129 million editions (Ref. $1). The country of publication is known for 85.3% of these editions, authors for\n87.8%, publication dates for 92.6%, and the language for 91.6%. Of the 15 million books scanned, the\ncountry of publication is known for 91.5%, authors for 92.1%, publication dates for 95.1%, and the\nlanguage for 98.6%.\n\n].2. Digitization\n\nWe describe the way books are scanned and digitized. For publisher-provided books, Google removes\nthe spines and scans the pages with industrial sheet-fed scanners. For library-provided books, Google\nuses custom-built scanning stations designed to impose only as much wear on the book as would result\nfrom someone reading the book. As the pages are turned, stereo cameras overhead photograph each\npage, as shown in Figure $1.\n\nOne crucial difference between sheet-fed scanners and the stereo scanning process is the flatness of the\npage as the image is captured. In sheet-fed scanning, the page is kept flat, similar to conventional flatbed\nscanners. With stereo scanning, the book is cradled at an angle that minimizes stress on the spine of the\nbook (this angle is not shown in Figure $1). Though less damaging to the book, a disadvantage of the\nlatter approach is that it results in a page that is curved relative to the plane of the camera. The curvature\nchanges every time a page is turned, for several reasons: the attachment point of the page in the spine\ndiffers, the two stacks of pages change in thickness, and the tension with which the book is held open\nmay vary. Thicker books have more page curvature and more variation in curvature.\n\nThis curvature is measured by projecting a fixed infrared pattern onto each page of the book,\nsubsequently captured by cameras. When the image is later processed, this pattern is used to identify the\nlocation of the spine and to determine the curvature of the page. Using this curvature information, the\nscanned image of each page is digitally resampled so that the results correspond as closely as possible\nto the results of sheet-fed scanning. The raw images are also digitally cropped, cleaned, and contrast\nenhanced. Blurred pages are automatically detected and rescanned. Details of this approach can be\nfound in U.S. Patents 7463772 and 7508978; sample results are shown in Figure S2.\n\nFinally, blocks of text are identified and optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert those\nimages into digital characters and words, in an approach described elsewhere (Ref. $2). The difficulty of\napplying conventional OCR techniques to Google\u2019s scanning effort is compounded because of variations\nin language, font, size, paper quality, and the physical condition of the books being scanned.\nNevertheless, Google estimates that over 98% of words are correctly digitized for modern English books.\nAfter OCR, initial and trailing punctuation is stripped and word fragments split by hyphens are joined,\nyielding a stream of words suitable for subsequent indexing.\n\n1.3. Structure Extraction\n\nAfter the book has been scanned and digitized, the components of the scanned material are classified\ninto various types. For instance, individual pages are scanned in order to identify which pages comprise\nthe authored content of the book, as opposed to the pages which comprise frontmatter and backmatter,\nsuch as copyright pages, tables of contents, index pages, etc. Within each page, we also identify\nrepeated structural elements, such as headers, footers, and page numbers.\n\nUsing OCR results from the frontmatter and backmatter, we automatically extract author names, titles,\nISBNs, and other identifying information. This information is used to confirm that the correct consensus\nrecord has been associated with the scanned text.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017012\n", "sample": "periodicals such as newspapers).

U.S. colonies and states created public prosecution offices much\nearlier than England. 77\n\n[*868] Even so, in the nation's earliest decades, those officials were often part-time or short-term officials, whose duties were\noften primarily quasi-judicial or administrative. 7\u00ae For those reasons, in many states those officials coexisted alongside private\nprosecutors with whom they shared some similarities. Early public prosecutors were paid by the case or the conviction \u201d and\npursued cases from private complainants. \u00b0\u00b0 But by the mid-nineteenth century, every state had public prosecutor offices of\nsome sort. \u00ae! Increasingly, they were full-time and accompanied by [*869] public police forces. In this context, private\nprosecutions diminished, then vanished. \u00b0?\n\nHowever, because public prosecutors continued to suffer from poor funding (and consequently were held in low regard), *\u00b0\n\nsome states continued an alternate form of private prosecution: privately funded attorneys could assist in criminal prosecutions\nas long as the public prosecutor supervised or retained formal control. *4 This form of ancillary or supplementary private\nprosecution, which leaves charging decisions in public hands, is still permitted in several states. \u00b0\u00b0 Otherwise, only vestiges of\nprivate [*870] prosecution remain in a few states. Pennsylvania seems to have the strongest version: it permits private\nprosecutions for any offense upon the approval from a state prosecutor or a judge. *\u00ae\u00b0 Rhode Island authorizes private\nprosecutions only for misdemeanors. 8\u2019 Under state common law, New Hampshire might permit the same for nonjailable\noffenses. \u00b0\u00b0 Beyond that, judges in many states can issue an arrest warrant or criminal summons based on a private person's\ntestimony, but public prosecutors control whether to go forward with the case. 8?\n\n[*871] In sum, U.S. jurisdictions are unusual among common law jurisdictions in having abolished private prosecution as a\nmeans to vindicate victims' private interests, a supplement to public enforcement resources, and a structural check on selective\nunderenforcement from biases in public prosecutors\u2019 discretionary decisions not to charge. English authorities, in contrast,\nexplicitly recognize this public function for private prosecution. Private actors\u2019 authority to second-guess declination decisions -\ncharging decision redundancy - operates as \"the ultimate safeguard for the citizen against inaction on the part of the\nauthorities.\" \u00b0\u00b0 The only remnant of this view in the United States seems to be in Pennsylvania.

Only a few jurisdictions, such as California and the federal system,\nprovide for meaningful enforcement of participation rights by, for example, allowing victims to intervene in trial proceedings to demand\nrights, or to appeal trial court violations; to facilitate a remedy, courts may order that a guilty plea or sentence be re-opened.

Allowing private actors to begin prosecutions meets \"the need for a\nsystem of checks and balances on the office of the district attorney\" and \"constitutes a recognition by the legislature that the\noffice of the district attorney should be subject to a system of checks and balances.\" \u00b0!\n\nThe rarity of private charges in jurisdictions that authorize them hardly justifies their abolition. Private prosecutions should be\nrare in well-functioning public prosecution systems, because public agencies pursue most provable cases and because private\nactors must bear considerable costs to press charges themselves. Moreover, other rules and institutions - including other\nsafeguards on prosecutorial charging - endure despite few indications of their utility. There has never been a successful claim\nthat a criminal charge violated the Equal Protection prohibition on racially biased charging, \u00b0\u201d but few argue the doctrine lacks\nat least normative value. \u00b0\u00b0 Grand juries rarely reject prosecutors\u2019 [*872] charging requests for indictments, but courts\ncontinue to tout them as a structural check on prosecutors. \u00b0+ Like private prosecution, these safeguards may work by deterring\nbiased or ill-conceived prosecutorial decisions; their efficacy 1s probably impossible to measure.\n\nA contributing explanation for the U.S. aversion to private prosecution may lie mn a familiar theme of U.S. law and history:\nrace. During the first several decades of the nineteenth century, when private citizens could prosecute crimes, many states - and\n\nnot only Southern ones - either denied African Americans legal capacity as litigants \u00b0\u00b0\n\nor barred them from testifying under\noath on the basis of race. Among other effects, those barriers barred private prosecutions by African Americans. \u00b0\u00b0 After 1865\n- an era in which rights to litigate and testify were viewed by many as more meaningful than the right to vote ?\u2019 - those race-\nbased legal disabilities were abolished. \u00b0\u00b0 In the same period, private charging authority, already on the decline, was abolished\nin most [*873] states that still permitted it. States that retained a formal litigation role for crime victims did so by allowing\nprivately funded attorneys to assist in prosecutions filed and controlled by public prosecutors, thus ensuring that public officials\nare the exclusive gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement. Between the 1840s and 1860s, prosecutors had become locally\nelected officials in nearly all states. That effectively aligned their charging monopoly with the preferences of local white\nmajorities (or white minorities in localities in which black citizens were the majority, once Southern whites succeeded in\n\ndisenfranchising black citizens). \u00b0? Evidence for the relationship between race and the demise of private prosecution is\n\n6? Among myriad examples are crimes of preparation, conspiracy, possession of contraband, consensual exchanges (e.g., of drugs or sex for\nmoney), and many kinds of criminal attempts.

L. Rev. 844, *899\n\nThis basic overview - drawn from a substantial scholarly literature - paints a somewhat contradictory picture. On the one hand,\nthe primary story is one of longstanding underenforcement - a combination of explicit legal policies, practical evidence-\ngathering and proof challenges, and cultural biases resulted in a notoriously weak response to sexual assaults by state criminal\njustice systems. On the other hand, there is a story, over the last forty years or so, of wide-ranging success in achieving reforms\non several fronts - substantive and procedural law, institutional design, and resource allocation - designed to improve\nenforcement capacity. In other words, U.S. jurisdictions made substantial progress against an ingrained tradition of\nunderenforcement without turning to any model of enforcement redundancy - federalization, private prosecution, or judicial\nreview. That is more than state justice systems were ever able to do with regard to local government corruption, where the\nremedy instead was the rise of federal criminal law enforcement.\n\nAnd yet, few seem to consider this reform story a success. !*8 The data on underreporting by victims, low arrest rates by\npolice, and charging rates by prosecutors (along with the rape kit [*900] testing backlog) make it easy to view state criminal\njustice systems as failing to achieve adequate enforcement responses to sexual assaults despite the scope and gravity of the\nproblem - 124,000 offenses reported to police in 2015, and 431,000 assault reports estimated by the National Crime Victim\nSurvey. 189\n\nThis story of reform, its decidedly limited success, and the responses to that record all reveal insights about the prospects for\nredressing underenforcement through redundancy in this context. Intersecting feminist, victim rights, and rape-law-reform\nmovements have achieved some remarkable reforms through the political process over the last four decades. U.S. criminal\njustice, like U.S. public law generally, is responsive to popular sentiment, well-organized reform movements, and interest\ngroups. !?\u00b0 But these movements never sought any mechanism of enforcement redundancy, and federal and state lawmakers\nnever seriously considered one. Even now, when offense definitions, victim rights, evidentiary rules, and organizational\nchanges in law enforcement agencies offer few plausible options for further improvement, there is effectively no sign of\ninterest in private prosecution and judicial or administrative oversight. Instead, the sole focus of further innovation to address\nendemic underenforcement of sexual assault offenses is the federal government. And most federal policy - and policy proposals\n- stop short of expanding federal law to cover sexual assaults now within the jurisdiction solely of state courts. !\u00b0!

Accuracy of Date-of-Publication metadata\n\nAccurate date-of-publication data is crucial component in the production of time-resolved n-grams data.\nBecause our study focused most centrally on the English language corpus, we decided to apply more\nstringent inclusion criteria in order to make sure the accuracy of the date-of-publication data was as high\nas possible.\n\nWe found that the lion's share of date-of-publication errors were due to so-called 'bound-withs' - single\nvolumes that contain multiple works, such as anthologies or collected works of a given author. Among\nthese bound-withs, the most inaccurately dated subclass were serial publications, such as journals and\nperiodicals. For instance, many journals had publication dates which were erroneously attributed to the\nyear in which the first issue of the journal had been published. These journals and serial publications also\nrepresented a different aspect of culture than the books did. For these reasons, we decided to filter out all\nserial publications to the extent possible. Our \u2018Serial Killer\u2019 algorithm removed serial publications by\nlooking for suggestive metadata entries, containing one or more of the following:\n\n1. Serial-associated titles, containing such phrases as \u2018Journal of, 'US Government report\u2019, etc.\n\n2. Serial-associated authors, such as those in which the author field is blank, too numerous, or\ncontains words such as 'committee\u2019.\n\nNote that the match is case-insensitive, and it must be to a complete word in the title; thus the filtering of\ntitles containing the word \u2018digest\u2019 does not lead to the removal of works with \u2018digestion\u2019 in the title. The\nentire list of serial-associated title phrases and serial-associated author phrases is included as\nsupplemental data (Appendix).

Foreign language corpora were\nfiltered in a similar fashion.\n\nThis filtering step markedly increased the accuracy of the metadata dates.

Overview of Google Books Digitization\n\nIn 2004, Google began scanning books to make their contents searchable and discoverable online. To\ndate, Google has scanned over fifteen million books: over 11% of all the books ever published. The\ncollection contains over five billion pages and two trillion words, with books dating back to as early as\n1473 and with text in 478 languages. Over two million of these scanned books were given directly to\nGoogle by their publishers; the rest are borrowed from large libraries such as the University of Michigan\nand the New York Public Library. The scanning effort involves significant engineering challenges, some of\nwhich are highly relevant to the construction of the historical n-grams corpus. We survey those issues\nhere.\n\nThe result of the next three steps is a collection of digital texts associated with particular book editions, as\nwell as composite metadata for each edition combining the information contained in all metadata sources.\n\nI.1. Metadata\n\nOver 100 sources of metadata information were used by Google to generate a comprehensive catalog of\nbooks. Some of these sources are library catalogs (e.g., the list of books in the collections of University of\nMichigan, or union catalogs such as the collective list of books in Bosnian libraries), some are from\nretailers (e.g., Decitre, a French bookseller), and some are from commercial aggregators (e.g., Ingram).\nIn addition, Google also receives metadata from its 30,000 partner publishers. Each metadata source\nconsists of a series of digital records, typically in either the MARC format favored by libraries, or the ONIX\nformat used by the publishing industry. Each record refers to either a specific edition of a book or a\nphysical copy of a book on a library shelf, and contains conventional bibliographic data such as title,\nauthor(s), publisher, date of publication, and language(s) of publication.\n\nCataloguing practices vary widely among these sources, and even within a single source over time. Thus\ntwo records for the same edition will often differ in multiple fields. This is especially true for serials (e.g.,\nthe Congressional Record) and multivolume works such as sets (e.g., the three volumes of The Lord of\nthe Rings).\n\nThe matter is further complicated by ambiguities in the definition of the word \u2018book\u2019 itself. Including\ntranslations, there are over three thousand editions derived from Mark Twain\u2019s original Tom Sawyer.\n\nGoogle\u2019s process of converting the billions of metadata records into a single nonredundant database of\nbook editions consists of the following principal steps:\n\n1. Coarsely dividing the billions of metadata records into groups that may refer to the same\nwork (e.g., Tom Sawyer).\n\n2. Identifying and aggregating multivolume works based on the presence of cues from individual\nrecords.\n\n3. Subdividing the group of records corresponding to each work into constituent groups\ncorresponding to the various editions (e.g., the 1909 publication of De lotgevallen van Tom\nSawyer, translated from English to Dutch by Johan Braakensiek).\n\n4. Merging the records for each edition into a new \u201cconsensus\u201d record.\n\nThe result is a set of consensus records, where each record corresponds to a distinct book edition and\nwork, and where the contents of each record are formed out of fields from multiple sources. The number\nof records in this set -- i.e., the number of known book editions -- increases every year as more books are\nwritten.\n\nIn August 2010, this evaluation identified 129 million editions, which is the working estimate we use in this\npaper of all the editions ever published (this includes serials and sets but excludes kits, mixed media, and\n\n3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017011\n", "sample": "I.

L. Rev. 844, *864\n\nPublic prosecutors now dominate enforcement decisions in both common law-based and civil law-based justice systems\nworldwide. That is hardly surprising, given the far-reaching regulatory scope of modern criminal law and high expectations that\nthe state will ensure security against social disorder and innumerable harms, and will intervene in risk creation long before\nmanifest criminal conduct or injury. \u00a9 That agenda requires capacity, resources, and expertise that only public agencies can\nmarshal. Moreover, a criminal enforcement regime that relied heavily on private plaintiffs would be one skewed against redress\nfor poor victims who cannot bear litigation costs to vindicate their own interests. 7\u00b0 Without safeguards, such a regime [*865]\nalso could be at the mercy of the varied, perhaps idiosyncratic motives and interests of private actors lodging criminal\ncomplaints.\n\nStill, many countries continue to authorize private citizens to initiate criminal prosecutions when public officials do not, and\nothers allow privately funded attorneys to assist or supplement public prosecutors in litigating criminal cases. Canada,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and England and Wales all continue to allow private prosecutions, 7! and fifteen of the twenty-eight\nmember states of the European Union grant victims some comparable [*866] authority. \u2019* Details vary across jurisdictions,\nbut everywhere private prosecutors\u2019 authority is limited by oversight from public [*867] prosecutors and courts. 7 The\nstandard common law model is that public prosecutors retain the power to take over privately filed charges and then either try\nthe case themselves, negotiate a plea bargain, or - more commonly when intervention occurs - dismiss the charges altogether.\nIn this framework, private actors can press charges when public officials do not, but functionally they serve primarily as a\nmechanism for political accountability. Through private charging in the wake of public prosecutors\u2019 declination, victims force\npublic officials to justify publicly their reasons for not charging and for vetoing privately filed charges - and to do so on\ngrounds other than public resource constraints, given that a private actor has offered to bear the costs. Given the private cost\nbarriers and the capacity of public prosecution agencies, it is unsurprising that, even where permitted, privately initiated\n\ncharges nonetheless contribute to a tiny fraction of prosecutions on criminal dockets.\n\n2. Abolition of Private Prosecution in State Criminal Justice\n\n75\n\nU.S. jurisdictions are comparative exceptions; nearly all long ago prohibited privately initiated prosecutions, \u2018\u00b0 even though in\n\nother contexts private actors continue to enforce public law in service of public interests. 7\u00b0 But private criminal charges were\n\n57 See Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21, at 20-51. Federal funding to state and local enforcement agencies is a more direct example\nof supplementing resources.

L. Rev. 844, *894\n\nbranch is firmly committed to a robust enforcement policy against local government corruption that is also criminalized under\nstate law, and Congress has supported this agenda by enacting federal crimes intended to duplicate, or greatly overlap, state\noffenses. !\u00b04 In fact, federal statutes used in anti-corruption cases - [*895] like other federal criminal statutes - rely on and\nincorporate state law in federal offense definitions. In light of this structure, federal prosecutions can claim to effectuate state\n\nlaw goals - an especially straightforward version of federalism-based enforcement redundancy. !\u00ae\n\n2. Sexual Assault\n\nIn sharp contrast to public corruption, enforcement redundancy through coextensive jurisdiction is largely nonexistent for a\nlarge portion of the serious crimes that dominate state felony dockets, including sexual assaults, domestic violence, and\nhomicide. !\u00b0\u00b0 Federal law reaches only a small number of these offenses when they intersect a special basis for federal\njurisdiction, such as interstate conduct - like human trafficking - or wrongs that occur on federal property or involve federal\nemployees. '\u00ae\u2019 For most kinds of homicides, the lack of redundancy is only a modest hindrance to adequate enforcement;\nholding aside distinctive exceptions - such as homicides by police or racially motivated lynchings - there 1s little evidence to\nsuggest patterns of homicide underenforcement in state justice systems. !\u00b0\u00b0 Domestic violence and sexual assaults are a\ndifferent story. Like local public corruption, sexual assaults have long been a key example of [*896] serious wrongdoing to\nwhich the responses of state and local criminal justice agencies have been deeply problematic. 1\u00b0\n\nUnderenforcement is hard to measure for sexual assaults as it is in other contexts, but central features of the problem are clear\nenough. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are dramatically underreported crimes. !7\u00b0 The leading government effort to\ncollect data on sexual assaults (and other crimes), the National Crime Victimization Survey, is widely thought to undercount\nincidents of those offenses. !7! And rates of victim reports to police departments are even lower. The FBI Uniform Crime\nReports collects data on sexual assaults reported to local police agencies; the number is consistently well below the annual\nnumber reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey. !7?\n\nOne reason that victims do not to report rapes to law enforcement is the perception that police and prosecutors (as well as\njuries) are unduly skeptical of rape allegations.

Rev. 844, *862\n\nUnder the criminal justice systems of all other major common law countries and nearly all European states, victims\u2019 rights also\ninclude authority to challenge prosecutors\u2019 decisions not to prosecute, either by a limited right to initiate prosecutions as private\nparties or by enabling victims to trigger judicial or [*863] administrative review of noncharging decisions. \u00b0* By contrast,\nnearly every U.S. jurisdiction rejects these mechanisms. State and federal laws consistently avoid permitting victims any power\nto challenge or encroach on public prosecutorial authority. Federal law, for example, explicitly dictates that \"nothing im this\n[victims' rights] chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under\nhis direction.\" \u00a9? State statutes manifest the same policy in various ways, such as by prohibiting legal remedies for violations\nof participation rights they create. \u00ae+ U.S. laws limit victims\u2019 participation to \"non-dispositive\" forms, such as providing\ninformation and personal statements to prosecutors, judges, and parole boards, which facilitates victims\u2019 influence on public\nofficials' decisionmaking. \u00ae But state and federal policy rejects enlisting victims as \"agents of accountability\" for public\nprosecution. \u00b0\u00b0\n\nIn U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, the conceptual innovation of victims\u2019 rights laws was to recognize victims\u2019 distinct private\n[*864] interests in public criminal litigation. Most rights are specific entitlements to advance victims' broader, dignitary right\nto be \"treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity.\" \u00b0\u201d These provisions conceive of victims as \"agents of\nindividual rights\" and \"independent from systemic interests,\" and their interests can either conflict or align with those of law\nenforcement. \u00a9 At the same time, victim participation rights can also be understood to serve a broader public interest in\nprocedural outcomes, on the premise, for example, that prosecutors\u2019 and judges\u2019 decisions will improve with direct input from\nvictims. Public decisionmaking risks substantive deficiency, and criminal process would be procedurally deficient, without due\nregard for victims\u2019 interests. Jurisdictions that empower victims to challenge non-prosecution decisions enable private parties\nthemselves to address the problem of criminal law underenforcement.

Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be\nassessed. Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.\n\nSteve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited\nand he was 90% complete with the job. He was just waiting on his final inspection\nand he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all construction\ninspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on Mr. Smith\u2019s\nbehalf to request a three (3) week extension. Mr. Walton said the Town did not\noppose the extension of time. Mr. Walton said the three weeks was necessary\nbecause the building would not let inspections be done while their maintenance\nman was on vacation. Mr. Walton said if compliance was not achieved by August\n7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to commence on August 8,\n2008.\n\nMs. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that\nit is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to\nbegin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other\nowners.

Mr. Merola read subsection (h) into the record\nand said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any jurisdiction over\nsubsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g). The Town filed a\nlawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy this morning. The Town\nis asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and asking for a permanent\ninjunction, stating an emergency situation. Judge Hoy gave them a hearing at 1:30\np-m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the dog is a nuisance,\nwhether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board has authority over\n10-45 (1). If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not going to argue with the\nCourt but he believes they have a right to present their case. He does not believe\nthe Town\u2019s position that the fine should start tomorrow is correct. He believes the\nBoard can only find violations of subsections (d) through (g) of 10-45. There have\nbeen no allegations that Dr. Lynn has violated subsections (d) through (g). Mr.\nMerola believes it is clear that the Code Enforcement Board has no authority\nunder (i). Mr. Merola then addressed 10-6 and said he believed that since all\nprecautions have been taken under 10-45, the dog does not constitute a nuisance.\nMr. Merola said he has an injunction relief request before the Judge to stop the\nBoard from making this decision. Mr. Merola said Mr. Randolph has asked them\nto determine these two (2) ordinances separately and he does not believe 10-45 (1)\nis in the Board\u2019s purview, and as to the nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now\nand it is not. This is all going to be determined Tuesday and he is asking the Board\nto either deny the Town\u2019s recommendation because the Town cannot prove the\ndog is a nuisance now or reset this case until next month\u2019s hearing.\n\nSgt. Krauel advised he wanted to make a rebuttal to some of Mr. Merola\u2019s\ncomments. The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog\ndangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008\nand was told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County. A notice\ncould not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with something\nhe was already in compliance with. The dog was not in the Town. The police\ndepartment did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20\" when Laura Klein\nreported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is\nwhen the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45. Dr. Lynn\nwas given the entire ordinance on June 10\", not just sections or specific acts that\nhe needed to comply with. Duke was not on the property at that time and no\nnotification to remove the dog from the property could be served then because the\ndog was not there. As far as the police department was concerned, Dr. Lynn was\nin compliance with the ordinance. Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the Town does not\nabide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the ability to\nenforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have done here.\n\nSgt. Krauel said he was prepared, based on Counsel\u2019s recommendation, to\nrecommend a motion to find Dr. Lynn in non-compliance with Section 10-6 and\nmove to postpone 10-45 (i) until after further consideration by the Circuit Court\non Tuesday.

It was just a matter of scaling up the whole system that makes this possible\ntoday. There are maybe five thousand picturable common nouns in English, ten thousand\nif you include things like special kinds of plants and beetles which people would\nrecognize with some frequency. What we did was train our system on 30 million images\nof these kinds of things. It\u2019s a big, complicated, messy neural network. The details of\nthe network probably don\u2019t matter, but it takes about a quadrillion GPU operations to do\nthe training.\n\nOur system is impressive because it pretty much matches what humans can do. It\nhas about the same training data humans have\u2014about the same number of images a\nhuman infant would see in the first couple of years of its life. Roughly the same number\nof operations have to be done in the learning process, using about the same number of\nneurons in at least the first levels of our visual cortex. The details are different; the way\nthese artificial neurons work has little to do with how the brain\u2019s neurons work. But the\nconcept is similar, and there\u2019s a certain universality to what\u2019s going on. At the\nmathematical level, it\u2019s a composition of a very large number of functions, with certain\ncontinuity properties that let you use calculus methods to incrementally train the system.\nGiven those attributes, you can end up with something that does the same job human\nbrains do in physiological recognition.\n\nBut does this constitute AI? There are a few basic components. There\u2019s\nphysiological recognition, there\u2019s voice-to-text, there\u2019s language translation\u2014things\nhumans manage to do with varying degrees of difficulty. These are essentially some of\nthe links to how we make machines that are humanlike in what they do. For me, one of\nthe interesting things has been incorporating those capabilities into a precise symbolic\nlanguage to represent the everyday world. We now have a system that can say, \u201cThis is a\nglass of water.\u201d We can go from a picture of a glass of water to the concept of a glass of\nwater. Now we have to invent some actual symbolic language to represent those\nconcepts.\n\nI began by trying to represent mathematical, technical kinds of knowledge and\nwent on to other kinds of knowledge. We\u2019ve done a pretty good job of representing\nobjective knowledge in the world. Now the problem is to represent everyday human\ndiscourse in a precise symbolic way\u2014a knowledge-based language intended for\ncommunication between humans and machines, so that humans can read it and machines\ncan understand it, too. For instance, you might say \u201cX is greater than 5.\u201d That\u2019s a\npredicate. You might also say, \u201cI want a piece of chocolate.\u201d That\u2019s also a predicate. It\nhas an \u201cI want\u201d in it. We have to find a precise symbolic representation of the desires we\nexpress in human natural language.\n\nIn the late 1600s, Gottfried Leibniz, John Wilkins, and others were concerned\nwith what they called philosophical languages\u2014that is, complete, universal, symbolic\nrepresentations of things in the world. You can look at the philosophical language of\nJohn Wilkins and see how he divided up what was important in the world at the time.\nSome aspects of the human condition have been the same since the 1600s. Some are very\ndifferent. His section on death and various forms of human suffering was huge; in\ntoday\u2019s ontology, it\u2019s alot smaller. It\u2019s interesting to see how a philosophical language\nof today would differ from a philosophical language of the mid-1600s. It\u2019s a measure of\nour progress. Many such attempts at formalization have happened over the years.

Mr. Fried asked Mr.\nRandolph if he would explain the reason for this. Mr. Randolph said the argument\nhad been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been\ndeemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town\u2019s Code. Mr.\nRandolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday\nthat it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (i)\nbecause that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been\ndeclared dangerous. The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done\neverything he is required to do. Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further\nif the matter was going to be deferred. Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is\nthat item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through\n(h). It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to\nthe Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-\n45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the\nsections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code\nEnforcement Board and 10-45 is listed. Code Enforcement has the right to bring a\nviolation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set\nforth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in\nconsidering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting.\n\nMr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been\npresented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put\n\n11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016584\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\non Tuesday.

See id. at 59-61\n(describing injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 /4/41, noting limits on data about police misconduct, and explaining how insufficient data\nlimits the effectiveness of reform efforts).

See generally, e.g., Steven B. Duke & Albert C. Gross, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs (1993)\n(examining and critiquing American drug policies).\n\n199 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 (2012) (criminalizing conspiracy); id. \u00a7 242 (criminalizing willful deprivation of federal rights while acting\nunder color of law); id. \u00a7 249 (criminalizing willful bodily injury because of victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity).\nFederal prosecutors focus on other serious direct-victim crimes as well, such as human trafficking and child pornography. See U.S. Dep't of\nJustice, supra note 145 (describing prioritization of such cases). But federal involvement in that realm is presumably motivated not so much\nby a need for oversight of untrustworthy state prosecutors as by the greater resources, expertise, and interstate jurisdictional advantages that\nfederal prosecutors bring to such cases. Criminal prosecution is only one aspect of federal policies to reduce custodial deaths and improper\nuses of force by police. Other strategies include investigating abuse and corruption in local police agencies and using civil injunctive\nremedies against those agencies to change patterns of wrongdoing, as well as gathering data on custodial deaths and police uses of force.

At\nthat same hearing, Code Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of\nCode Enforcement to get more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and\nthat these projects were to be more aggressively pursued. Under the new\nordinance, for a house of approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to\n24 months. This would have brought them to November 2007 and they would\nhave gotten additional time for Hurricane Wilma which would have brought them\nto December. If they were under the new Code, they would not be before the\nBoard today and may not have a fine at all. He realizes a mistake was made, he\nrealizes something has to be paid but he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine. The\nBoard has gotten their attention and they would ask for a significant reduction in\nthe fine.\n\nMr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months\nhad run. Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes\nand they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that. Mr. Ballentine asked how far out\nthey would be under the new rules. Mr. Walton said they would be given 24\nmonths which with the hurricane would be 25 months.

Mr. Wagner\u2019s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have\nbecome irrelevant because they would have been red tagged on that next day after\nthe 24 month period. Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has\nbeen a good corporate citizen, he had never been before the Board except on one\noccasion and that was beyond his control, it was a maintenance item on the Glazer\nhouse.

In the case of magnetic materials, there are plenty of ways to do that.\nIn terms of programs, it\u2019s the same story. There are all kinds of programs out there, even\ntiny programs that do complicated things. Could we entrain them for some useful human\npurpose?\n\nAnd how do you get Als to execute your goals? One answer is to just talk to\nthem, in the natural language of human utterances. It works pretty well when you\u2019re\ntalking to Siri. But when you want to say something longer and more complicated, it\ndoesn\u2019t work well. You need a computer language that can represent sophisticated\nconcepts in a way that can be progressively built up and isn\u2019t possible in natural\nlanguage. What my company spent a lot of time doing was building a knowledge-based\nlanguage that incorporates the knowledge of the world directly into the language. The\ntraditional approach to creating a computer language is to make a language that\nrepresents operations that computers intrinsically know how to do: allocating memory,\nsetting values of variables, iterating things, changing program counters, and so on.\nFundamentally, you\u2019re telling computers to do things in your own terms. My approach\nwas to make a language that panders not to the computers but to the humans, to take\nwhatever a human thinks of and convert it into some form that the computer can\nunderstand. Could we encapsulate the knowledge we\u2019d accumulated, both in science and\nin data collection, into a language we could use to communicate with computers? That\u2019s\nthe big achievement of my last thirty years or so\u2014being able to do that.\n\nBack in the 1960s, people would say things like, \u201cWhen we can do such-and-\nsuch, we\u2019ll know we have AI. When we can do an integral from a calculus course, we\u2019ll\nknow we have AI. When we can have a conversation with a computer and make it seem\nhuman... ,\u201d et cetera. The difficulty was, \u201cWell, gosh, the computer just doesn\u2019t know\nenough about the world.\u201d You\u2019d ask the computer what day of the week it was, and it\nmight be able to answer that. You'd ask it who the President was, and it probably\ncouldn\u2019t tell you. At that point, you\u2019d know you were talking to a computer and not a\nperson. But now when it comes to these Turing Tests, people who\u2019 ve tried connecting,\nfor example, Wolfram|Alpha to their Turing Test bots find that the bots lose every time.\nBecause all you have to do 1s start asking the machine sophisticated questions and it will\nanswer them! No human can do that. By the time you\u2019ve asked it a few disparate\nquestions, there will be no human who knows all those things, yet the system will know\nthem. In that sense, we\u2019ve already achieved good AI, at that level.\n\nThen there are certain kinds of tasks easy for humans but traditionally very hard\nfor machines. The standard one is visual object identification: What is this object?\nHumans can recognize it and give some simple description of it, but a computer was just\nhopeless at that. A couple of years ago, though, we brought out a little image-\nidentification system, and many other companies have done something similar\u2014ours\nhappens to be somewhat better than the rest. You show it an image, and for about ten\nthousand kinds of things, it will tell you what it is. It\u2019s fun to show it an abstract painting\nand see what it says. But it does a pretty good job.\n\nIt works using the same neural-network technology that McCulloch and Pitts\nimagined in 1943 and lots of us worked on in the early eighties. Back in the 1980s,\npeople successfully did OCR\u2014optical character recognition. They took the twenty-six\nletters of the alphabet and said, \u201cOK, is that an A? Is that a B? Is that a C?\u201d and so on.\n\n185\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016988\n", "sample": "and you turn that special capability to a human purpose, to something you want\ntechnology to do.

Now obscured\nby an ideology of a free-floating \u201cintelligence\u201d untethered by either hardware or flesh, AI\nhas forgotten the early days of cybernetics\u2019 uptake by artists. Those efforts are worth\nrevisiting; they modeled relations with what the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and\nF\u00e9lix Guattari have called the \u201cmachinic phylum,\u201d having to do with how humans think\nand feel in bodies engaged with a physical, material, emotionally stimulating, and\nsignaling world.\n\nCybernetics now seems to have collapsed into an all-pervasive discourse of AI\nthat was far from preordained. \u201cCybernetics,\u201d as a word, claimed postwar newness for\nconcepts that were easily four centuries old: notions of feedback, machine damping,\nbiological homeostasis, logical calculation, and systems thinking that had been around\nsince the Enlightenment (boosted by the Industrial Revolution). The names in this\nlineage include Descartes, Leibniz, Sadi Carnot, Clausius, Maxwell, and Watt. Wiener\u2019s\ncoinage nonetheless had profound cultural effects.4\u201d7 The ubiquity today of the prefix\n\u201ccyber-\u201d confirms the desire for a crisp signifier of the tangled relations between humans\nand machines. In Wiener\u2019s usage, things \u201ccyber\u201d simply involved \u201ccontrol and\ncommunication in the animal and the machine.\u201d But after the digital revolution, \u201ccyber\u201d\nmoved beyond servomechanisms, feedback loops, and switches to encompass software,\nalgorithms, and cyborgs. The work of cybernetically inclined artists concerns the\nemergent behaviors of life that elude AI in its current condition.\n\nAs to that original coinage, Wiener had reached back to the ancient Greek to\nborrow the word for \u201csteersman\u201d (kvBepvytns / kubern\u00e9t\u00e9s), a masculine figure\nchanneling power and instinct at the helm of a ship, who read the waves, judged the\nwind, kept a hand on the tiller, and directed the slaves as they mindlessly (mechanically)\nchurned their oars. The Greek had already migrated into modern English via Latin, going\n\n4\u201d Wiener later had to admit the earlier coinage of the word in 1834 by Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e9re, who had\nintended it to mean the \u201cscience of government,\u201d a concept that remained dormant until the 20th century.\n\n174\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016977\n", "sample": "THE ARTISTIC USE OF CYBERNETIC BEINGS\nCaroline A.

The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required.

On June 20,\n2008, 4 days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police\ndepartment sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog\nalready had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized.

He\nnoted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting\nseason. He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale\nBeach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season.

Mr. Maxey said he did not\nbelieve it was sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace\nevery tree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he\nbrought up other issues involved with the trimming. Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey\nhe just wanted to know whether he could comply in a 7 day period without going\ninto a lot of detail. Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant,\nhe had to first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had\nsome questions whether or not he could comply within the time period. He also\nsaid he had some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the\nlocal level had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in\nconsultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take. The Town\ndid not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the\nguidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone\nof those guidelines. The DEP counsel\u2019s office asked him to provide photographs\nof the Town\u2019s illegal cutting back in February.\n\nMr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not\nbe cut.

L. Rev. 844, *911\n\n[*912]\nCONCLUSION\n\nAll justice systems suffer from pockets of unjustified, even pernicious, underenforcement. All recognize that public\nprosecutors can be vulnerable to biases and institutional interests that distort enforcement decisions. Especially in recent\ndecades, nearly all have adopted mechanisms to address those risks. Outside the United States, victim rights legislation has\nincluded provisions directed at unjustified decisions not to prosecute. In other common law countries and in Europe, most\nvictims may now either seek independent review of prosecutors or initiate prosecutions on their own. Independent review keeps\nthe safeguard against underenforcement in public hands while strengthening the principle that charging decisions should be\nnonpolitical and ministerial in nature. Victim rights reforms in general manifest a judgment that modern criminal justice had\nfocused excessively on public interests and unduly neglected victims' private interests in criminal prosecutions. Authorizing\nvictims to challenge declination decisions extends this idea by recognizing victims\u2019 private stake in those decisions and\nenabling victims to serve the public interest in preventing unjustified failures to prosecute. 737\n\nVirtually all U.S. jurisdictions reject both of those strategies. 73\u00b0 And rather than insulate their prosecutors from political\n\n[*913] influence, most states rely on electoral politics for oversight of prosecution practices. Instead, the U.S. model opts for\nduplicative federal-state jurisdiction against a background of politically attuned state prosecutors. Both this federalism model of\nredundant prosecutorial authority - which may be reduced this term by the Supreme Court's decision in Gamble - and the model\nof politically responsive prosecutors have proven effective at redressing some types of underenforcement. Both serve some\nvictims\u2019 interests without taking the form of victim rights. And both reflect a preference for political over legal safeguards\nagainst biased or ill-conceived uses of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nAmerican criminal justice is more sanguine than other legal systems about the downsides of prosecutors\u2019 electoral\naccountability and attention to majoritarian sentiments. U.S. prosecutors\u2019 democratic legitimacy works against arguments for\nmore formal oversight or regulation.

Politically responsive\ncriminal justice sometimes works relatively well at changing prosecution practices to serve victim interests that majorities or\nstrong interest groups embrace. Politics has brought meaningful reforms to prosecution for drunk driving, for example, and it\nhas led to improvements, if still msufficient ones, regarding domestic violence and sexual assault crimes. But political\naccountability has not worked as well to remedy underenforcement when key victim groups have less public sympathy, or key\ndefendant groups, such as police, have a lot. Redundant prosecution authority, in the form of federal oversight, has a similarly\nmixed track record. Federal law has done much to compensate for state underenforcement of public corruption offenses. It has\nmade significant but less ambitious and successful commitments in the context of police violence. And federal authorities so far\nhave attempted to reinforce state sexual assault enforcement only at the margins.\n\nThe track record of the U.S. responses to underenforcement, then, is mixed. But it is not clear that the alternative safeguards\nthat predominate elsewhere are, on their own, clearly superior. Private prosecution is little use for victims with few financial\nresources or who are legally unsophisticated. Judicial review of declination can be exceedingly deferential, especially if statutes\nand regulations do not provide courts with clear criteria against which to assess prosecutorial decision making. Jurisdictions\nstrongly committed to reducing unjustified declinations would combine most or all of these mechanisms. U.S. jurisdictions\narguably have a history that should have made them especially likely to do so. States once permitted and relied on private\nprosecutions; judicial authority to review executive action, outside of prosecutor charging, is at least as robust here as in\nEngland; the movement for crime victim rights was as effective here as anywhere. The failure to devise more comprehensive\nsafeguards suggests that certain specific pockets of underenforcement - involving police, marginalized victim groups, and\nsexual assaults - are especially hard to remedy, regardless of readily available solutions.\n\nMinnesota Law Review\nCopyright (c) 2018 Minnesota Law Review Foundation\nMinnesota Law Review\n\nEnd of Document\n\nProsecution Service describes itself as \"an independent prosecution authority.\" See About the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Pub.\nProsecution Serv.

This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely\nacknowledges.\n\nAfter the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal\nCare and Control and after a hearing, was classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Sgt. Krauel\nnoted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify\nDuke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.\nAfter this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was\nalso found by the Town to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified\nby registered mail. Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was\ndenied by Town Council by a 5-0 vote. The Town recommends a finding of non-\ncompliance with Chapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required\naffidavits of residents of the Town occupying separate households. The Board\nwas provided with copies of four (4) affidavits.\n\nSgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and\nsaid the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of\nChapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) and that Dr. Lynn be given until July 18, 2008 to\ncome into compliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it\nhumanely euthanized. If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a\ndaily fine of $250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until\ncompliance is achieved.\n\nMr. Randolph requested the Board treat these two sections of the Code separate\nand apart. He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3) and\ninvolved the affidavits from the residents of the Town. Because of the dispute Dr.\nLynn\u2019s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied, Mr.\nRandolph recommended the two Code sections not be mixed up. Mr. Randolph\nsaid he would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a\nviolation of 10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the\nStaff's recommendation. He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained\nseparately after Dr. Lynn\u2019s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an\nopportunity to do so.\n\nVivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave., said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously\nattacked by Dr. Lynn\u2019s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in\nvet\u2019s bills. She said her dog will never walk properly again because of severe\nnerve damage. She does not feel there are enough precautions being taken for the\nsafety of residents on Brazilian Ave. She asked that the Board take this into\nconsideration and thanked them for their service.\n\nWayne Gerl, 149 Brazilian Ave., said he has two dogs and every time he exits his\ndriveway or front yard, he has to stop and peek around and make sure the other\n\n8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016623\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nSgt.

You likely know that ARCOM is working\nwith Mr. Trump to re-install a hedge on his North County Road property. | believe this case is now\npending in front of Code Enforcement. In May, ARCOM approved a plan to replace the former hedge\nwith silver buttonwood shrubbery, which would additionally be back-planted with silver buttonwood\ntrees....the overall effect would be an eventual 20' high screen. The shrubs have been planted, but\nyesterday attorney Ray Royce asked for postponing the trees until the end of the Hurricane season.\nARCOM said NO and directed the attorney and landscaper to get the trees in ASAP. Also, more\nshrubbery was required at the main entry (north side) to match the newly installed hedge on the south\nside.\n\nAs the meeting was ending, the Commissioners asked for one of two things. They asked that either 1) a\nquick written report from Code Enforcement be made available to them at their next meeting on July 23\n(9:00 a.m.) about the enforcement status of the case, or 2) that someone from Code Enforcement attend\ntheir meeting to provide a verbal status report. Their patience is wearing thin with the whole hedge issue,\nand it has them naturally curious about what is happening with their counterparts on Code Enforcement.\n\nWould you or the appropriate representative from Code Enforcement be available on July 23? That\n\nwould be my preference because follow-up questions almost always pop up. If not, can you provide me\nwith a brief summary of your enforcement history and pending status?

Sgt. Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police\ndepartment or had a time frame for when it occurred. Mr. Goodnough said he had\nnot made a police report but it occurred about two (2) years ago.\n\nLaura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having\nmoved here from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security. She said she was now\nin the process of installing surveillance cameras. She said she could no longer\nwalk her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again\nescaped from the open gates. She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog\nownership and responsibility should go hand in hand. She said Dr. Lynn was\nissued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows\nrolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility. She said his\nvoluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this. She said no\none was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.\n\nJames Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a\nrevised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008. He said he\nwas not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog\ntaken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was\nagreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as\ndangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required. Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a\nletter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of\nthe County and stating for the first time, the Town was declaring the dog\ndangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20,\n2008, four (4) days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police\ndepartment sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog\nalready had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized. The dog had not\ndone anything since being declared dangerous. This letter did not mention an\nappeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating that they did not agree with that. He\nsaid the dog was declared dangerous on the 16\", requirements were imposed and\nthey complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not\nagree the dog should now be removed. There was a Town Council hearing on\nAugust 8\" and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or\neuthanized.

This\n\"executive separation of powers\" model has proven effective, although whether it is effective enough is debated; it depends on\nwhether all cases of police violence that should have been prosecuted - based on the evidence and the public interest in\nenforcement - were prosecuted. State and federal prosecution offices have distinct professional cultures and are responsive to\ndifferent constituencies and modes of political supervision, which increases the independence of one from the other. 7!3 On the\nother hand, federal prosecution is still to some degree political; it varies with the policy priorities of presidential administrations\n714 to a degree that judicial review [*907] (in theory) should not. When there is less federal commitment to oversight of states\u2019\napproaches to police violence, enforcement redundancy is weak. 7!\u00b0 Victims and other interested parties have no other\nrecourse.\n\nC. Underenforcement and Prosecutor Political Accountability\n\nIn short, U.S. strategies of enforcement redundancy have a relatively strong track record for some crimes such as public\ncorruption, are robust but vulnerable to political shifts for others such as a police violence, and are notably weak with regard to\ncertain offenses, such as sexual assaults. That last category is important because that weakness extends well beyond sexual\nassault offenses; many of the routine crimes that make up typical state criminal dockets are not within the scope of federal\ncriminal law enforcement. And since private prosecution and judicial or administrative review of prosecutorial decisions are\nalmost completely absent from state criminal justice systems, there is no charging-decision oversight of state prosecutors\u2019\ndeclination decisions and enforcement policies - save for local electoral accountability. In forty-five of fifty states, chief\nprosecutors are directly elected in local constituencies. *!\u00a9 This form of democratic accountability operates as a kind of check\non underenforcement, although it has significant limits in its capacity to play that role.\n\nState prosecutors\u2019 elected status is likely the best explanation [*908] for why victim-based checks on declination - private\nprosecution or judicial review - never became a part of victims\u2019 rights reforms enacted in U-S. jurisdictions in recent decades.\nFirst, prosecutors are politically powerful groups with legislatures, and they zealously guard their unfettered discretion over\ncriminal charging. 7!7 Second, it has led even courts to disfavor any degree of judicial review of charging decisions, on the\n\nOn Justice Department professionalism, see Jim McGee & Brian Duffy, Main Justice: The Men and Women Who Enforce the Nation's\nCriminal Laws and Guard Its Liberties 7-9 (1996); Jed Handelsman Shugerman, The Creation of the Department of Justice:\nProfessionalization Without Civil Rights or Civil Service,66 Stan. L. Rev. 121, 125-26 (2014).\n\n142 The arguable exceptions are federal crimes for race-based and civil rights-related violence and for local officials\u2019 abuses of power; in\nthose realms federal authorities responded to widespread failures by state law enforcement and justice systems.

L. Rev. 844, *904\n\nU.S. victims lack a right to challenge noncharging decisions in cases of homicides by police. But they, along with organized\ninterest groups, can lobby prosecutors to prosecute. In some cities, voters and activist groups have pressured local prosecutors\non police violence cases. 7\u00b0 It is difficult to assess what role public sentiment plays (and should play) in charging decisions.\nBut it is not hard to find instances of potent political challenges to non-prosecution of police officers in the wake of fatal\nshootings. Chief prosecutors in Cleveland, Ohio, and Chicago, Illinois, lost reelection bids in the wake controversial failures to\ncharge police officers in fatal-shooting cases. 7\u00b07 In the midst of popular and activist attention on such cases, prosecutors in\nseveral other cities have charged officers for offenses related to suspects' deaths, with mixed records of success. 7\u00b08 Chicago\nprosecutors did so a year [*905] after police fatally shot a suspect and only upon public release of video of the incident 7\u00b0\u00b0 - a\nscenario that suggests public attention corrected a noncharging decision influenced by improper considerations.\n\nHowever, U.S. localities vary widely in their demographics, politics, and community sentiments toward these cases. 7!\u00b0 That\nvariation, plus local election of prosecutors, contributes to widely varying enforcement policies across prosecution offices. 7!!\nAnd it means victims who urge prosecutions when local majority sentiment disfavors it have lower odds of successfully\ninfluencing [*906] prosecutors. The political variability of local prosecutors\u2019 charging policies - and the vulnerability of those\ndecisions to local sentiment that favors unjustified underenforcement - are a key reason federal redundancy is important in this\ncontext. Given that police misconduct is an established part of the U.S. Justice Department's enforcement agenda, federal\nprosecutors should be a check on political judgments of local prosecutors. They also provide victims with a different agency to\n\nappeal to for investigation and prosecution.\n\nThis federalism-based model of redundant enforcement has advantages as a strategy to reduce risks of unmerited\nunderenforcement. The alternative model authorizing judicial review of declination decisions, as is used in England, relies on\nthe independence of judges from the prosecutors whom they review. *!* The federalism model relies on the independence of\nfederal prosecutors from state prosecutors and police. The executive branch of one sovereign scrutinizes the enforcement\nresponse of another. And it has the capacity to act on its independent judgment, while courts are confined to ordering\n\nB6 See United States v. Gamble, 694 Fed. App'x. 750 (11th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, Gamble vy. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2707 (2018). Even\nif the Court abolishes the dual sovereignty doctrine in Gamble, federal and state prosecutors will continue to be able to prosecute the same\noffenders for the same conduct in many cases. Under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932), the Double Jeopardy Clause\nprecludes multiple prosecutions only if the subsequent charge has the \"same elements\" as the first. See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688,\n696 (1993) (affirming Blockburger's same-elements test as the sole basis for double jeopardy claims). Unlike the firearm offenses that gave\nrise to Gamble's Double Jeopardy claim, federal and state crimes covering the same conduct often have distinct elements.

Mr. Merola read subsection\n(h) into the record and said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any\njurisdiction over subsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g).\nThe Town has filed a lawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy\nthis morning. The Town is asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and\nasking for a permanent injunction, stating an emergency situation. Judge Hoy gave\nthem a hearing at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the\ndog is a nuisance, whether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board\nhave authority over 10-45 (i). If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not\ngoing to argue with the Court but he believes they have a right to present their\ncase. He does not believe that the Town\u2019s position that the fine should start\ntomorrow is correct. He believes the Board can only find violations of subsections\n(d) through (g) of 10-45. There have been no allegations that Dr. Lynn has\nviolated subsections (d) through (g). Mr. Merola believes it is clear that the Code\nEnforcement Board has no authority under (i). Mr. Merola then addressed 10-6\nand said he believed that since all precautions have been taken under 10-45, the\ndog does not constitute a nuisance. Mr. Merola said that he has an injunction\nrelief request before the Judge to stop the Board from making this decision. Mr.\nMerola said Mr. Randolph has asked them to determine these two (2) ordinances\nseparately and he does not believe 10-45 (i) is in the Board\u2019s purview, and as to\nthe nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now and it is not. This is all going to be\ndetermined Tuesday and he is asking the Board to either deny the Town\u2019s\nrecommendation because the Town cannot prove the dog is a nuisance now or\nreset this case until next month\u2019s hearing.\n\nSgt. Krauel advised he wanted to make a rebuttal to some of Mr. Merola\u2019s\ncomments. The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog\ndangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008\nand had been told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County. A\nnotice could not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with\nsomething he was already in compliance with. The dog was not in the Town. The\npolice department did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20\" when Laura\nKlein reported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is\nwhen the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45. Dr. Lynn\nwas given the entire ordinance on June 10\", not just sections or specific acts that\nhe needed to comply with. Duke was not on the property at that time and no\nnotification to remove the dog from the property could be served at that time\nbecause the dog was not there. As far as the police department was concerned,\nDr. Lynn was in compliance with the ordinance. Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the\nTown does not abide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the\nability to enforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have\ndone here.\n\nSgt. Krauel said he was prepared, based on Counsel\u2019s recommendation, to\nrecommend a motion to find Dr. Lynn in non-compliance with Section 10-6 and\n\nmove to postpone 10-45 (i) until after further consideration by the Circuit Court\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016583\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nDr. Lynn had complied with all of those.

The Residence was subject to an\nAgreement between the Town of Palm Beach and the prior owner, Abraham Gosman, dated\nJanuary 31, 1990 and recorded in Official Records Book 6350, Page 1207, of the Public Records\nof Palm Beach County, Florida (\"Agreement\"). The Agreement provides that a hedge\ncontiguous to North County Road will be maintained and that in the event the hedge is damaged\nor destroyed, it will be replaced. The Agreement refers to the \"hedge\" in 9 separate places on the\nfirst page of the Agreement. The Agreement nowhere refers to, or requires, any trees.\n\nOn April 7, 2008 the Town gave notice of a code violation alleging that the hedge had not been\nmaintained or replaced. The original hedge had been destroyed by the hurricanes of 2005 and\ntwo subsequent replacement hedges had died due to salt spray. Therefore, Trump asked to\nreplace the ficus hedge with silver buttonwood hedge material. The Town staff advised that such\ndecision would have to be made by ARCOM. The Appellant appeared before ARCOM on May\n28, 2008. ARCOM approved silver buttonwood hedge material. ARCOM also requested that\ntrees be planted and requested a tree planting plan. Trump planted the hedge in accordance with\nthe Agreement.\n\nTrump returned to the Code Enforcement Board meeting on June 19, 2008. That Board deferred\nfurther consideration of the matter pending plantings requested by ARCOM.\n\nTrump appeared before ARCOM on June 25, 2008 and (a) sought reconsideration of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016597\n", "sample": "Fee- 7\n\nSaxe Fsee\nvt - F216\nDay - AK tan\nTRUMP PROPERTIES LLC - C.F\nc/o The Mar-a-Lago Club Pert ~ FRCON\n1100 South Ocean Boulevard\nPalm Beach, Florida 33480 RECEIVED\nJuly 3, 2008 JUL 7 2008\nMs. Susan", "file_stem": "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016597.jpg"}, {"file": "../data/images/IMAGES-20251113T140642Z-1-019/IMAGES/004/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016622.jpg", "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nthe truck he was out with had 2 other leaf blowers on the truck that he could\nidentify as being over 65dBA but he only tested the one they were using and wrote\na violation for that one.

Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a\nculmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years. Sgt. Krauel\nexplained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some\ngraphic photographs. Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented\ncases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.\n\nMr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this\nprocedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr.\nRandolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.\nOriginally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation\nbut ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which\nwas appealed to Town Council. Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time,\nDr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation\nwas issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to\ndetermine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time,\nwhether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of\nthe Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council. Mr. Hoffman questioned\nwhether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized\nor removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the\nBoard\u2019s determination. The Board was only to determine whether or not there\nhad been a violation of the Town Code.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016622\n", "sample": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nthe truck he was out with had 2 other leaf blowers on the truck that he could\nidentify as being over 65dBA but he only tested the one they were using a", "file_stem": "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016622.jpg"}, {"file": "../data/images/IMAGES-20251113T140642Z-1-019/IMAGES/004/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016608.jpg", "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 04/17/08\n\nin administrative costs and be given until June 18th, which is the day before the\nJune Code Enforcement Board meeting, to comply.

Mr.\nWeymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner\nregarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation\nwas mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date. The lot was cut\non or around July 2, 2008. This particular violation is a Class I violation under\nthe fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has\nthe ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation. Mr.\nWeymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property\nin considering the fine. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance,\nadministrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the\nmaximum fine for a repeat violation.\n\nMr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he\ncomes into compliance but he has to be notified. Mr. Weymer says there are times\nwhen he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been\nbefore the Board because he has not complied by the time set.

Their mean frequency declined\nthroughout the 20th century, and dipped below 10\u00b0 decades\nago (Fig. 2D, Inset).\n\nOur results suggest that culturomic tools will aid\nlexicographers in at least two ways: (1) finding low-frequency\nwords that they do not list; and (41) providing accurate\nestimates of current frequency trends to reduce the lag\nbetween changes in the lexicon and changes in the dictionary.\n\nThe Evolution of Grammar\n\nNext, we examined grammatical trends. We studied the\nEnglish irregular verbs, a classic model of grammatical\nchange (/4-/7). Unlike regular verbs, whose past tense is\ngenerated by adding \u2014ed ump/jumped), irregulars are\nconjugated idiosyncratically (stick/stuck, come/came, get/got)\n(15).\n\nAll irregular verbs coexist with regular competitors (e.g.,\n\u201cstrived\u201d and \u201cstrove\u201d) that threaten to supplant them (Fig.\n2E). High-frequency wregulars, which are more readily\nremembered, hold their ground better. For instance, we found\n\u201cfound\u201d (frequency: 5x10) 200,000 times more often than\nwe finded \u201cfinded.\u201d In contrast, \u201cdwelt\u201d (frequency: 1x10\u201d)\ndwelt in our data only 60 times as often as \u201cdwelled\u201d dwelled.\nWe defined a verb\u2019s \u201cregularity\u201d as the percentage of\ninstances in the past tense (i.e., the sum of \u201cdrived\u201d, \u201cdrove\u201d,\nand \u201cdriven\u201d) in which the regular form 1s used. Most\nwregulars have been stable for the last 200 years, but 16%\nunderwent a change in regularity of 10% or more (Fig. 2F).\n\nThese changes occurred slowly: it took 200 years for our\nfastest moving verb, \u201cchide\u201d, to go from 10% to 90%.\nOtherwise, each trajectory was sui generis; we observed no\ncharacteristic shape. For instance, a few verbs, like \u201cspill\u201d,\nregularized at a constant speed, but others, such as \u201cthrive\u201d\nand \u201cdig\u201d, transitioned in fits and starts (7). In some cases, the\ntrajectory suggested a reason for the trend. For example, with\n\u201csped/speeded\u201d the shift in meaning from \u201cto move rapidly\u201d\nand towards \u201cto exceed the legal limit\u201d appears to have been\nthe driving cause (Fig. 2G).\n\nSix verbs (burn, chide, smell, spell, spill, thrive)\nregularized between 1800 and 2000 (Fig. 2F). Four are\nremnants of a now-defunct phonological process that used +t\ninstead of \u2014ed; they are members of a pack of irregulars that\nsurvived by virtue of similarity (bend/bent, build/built,\nburn/burnt, learn/learnt, lend/lent, rend/rent, send/sent,\nsmell/smelt, spell/spelt, spill/spilt, and spoil/spoilt). Verbs\nhave been defecting from this coalition for centuries\n(wend/went, pen/pent, gird/girt, geld/gelt, and gild/gilt all\nblend/blent into the dominant \u2014ed rule). Culturomic analysis\nreveals that the collapse of this alliance has been the most\nsignificant driver of regularization in the past 200 years. The\nregularization of burnt, smelt, spelt, and spilt originated in the\nUS; the forms still cling to life in British English (Fig. 2E,F).\n\nBut the -t irregulars may be doomed in England too: each\nyear, a population the size of Cambridge adopts \u201cburned\u201d in\nlieu of \u201cburnt.\u201d\n\nThough irregulars generally yield to regulars, two verbs\ndid the opposite: light/lit and wake/woke. Both were irregular\nin Middle English, were mostly regular by 1800, and\nsubsequently backtracked and are irregular again today. The\nfact that these verbs have been going back and forth for\nnearly 500 years highlights the gradual nature of the\nunderlying process.\n\nStill, there was at least one instance of rapid progress by\nan irregular form. Presently, 1% of the English speaking\npopulation switches from \u201csneaked\u201d to \u201csnuck\u201d every year:\nsomeone will have snuck off while you read this sentence. As\nbefore, this trend is more prominent in the United States, but\nrecently sneaked across the Atlantic: America is the world\u2019s\nleading exporter of both regular and irregular verbs.\n\nOut with the Old\n\nJust as individuals forget the past (/8, 19), so do societies\n(20). To quantify this effect, we reasoned that the frequency\nof 1-grams such as \u201c1951\u201d could be used to measure interest\nin the events of the corresponding year, and created plots for\neach year between 1875 and 1975.\n\nThe plots had a characteristic shape. For example, \u201c1951\u201d\nwas rarely discussed until the years immediately preceding\n1951. Its frequency soared in 1951, remained high for three\nyears, and then underwent a rapid decay, dropping by half\nover the next fifteen years. Finally, the plots enter a regime\nmarked by slower forgetting: collective memory has both a\nshort-term and a long-term component.\n\nBut there have been changes. The amplitude of the plots is\nrising every year: precise dates are increasingly common.\nThere is also a greater focus on the present. For instance,\n\u201c1880\u201d declined to half its peak value in 1912, a lag of 32\nyears. In contrast, \u201c1973\u201d declined to half its peak by 1983, a\nlag of only 10 years. We are forgetting our past faster with\neach passing year (Fig. 3A).\n\nWe were curious whether our increasing tendency to forget\nthe old was accompanied by more rapid assimilation of the\nnew (2/). We divided a list of 154 inventions into time-\nresolved cohorts based on the forty-year interval in which\nthey were first invented (1800-1840, 1840-1880, and 1880-\n1920) (7).

This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely\nacknowledges.\n\nAfter the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal\nCare and Control and after a hearing, was classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d. Sgt. Krauel\nnoted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify\nDuke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.\nAfter this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was\nalso found to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified by registered\nmail. Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was denied by Town\nCouncil by a 5-0 vote. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance with\nChapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required affidavits of residents\nof the Town occupying separate households. The Board had been provided with\ncopies of four (4) affidavits.\n\nSgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and\nsaid the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of\nChapter 10, Section 10-45 (1) and that he be given until July 18, 2008 to come into\ncompliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it humanely\neuthanized. If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a daily fine of\n$250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until compliance is\nachieved.\n\nMr. Randolph requested that the Board treat these two sections of the Code\nseparate and apart. He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3)\nand involved the affidavits from the residents of the Town. Because of the dispute\nDr. Lynn\u2019s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied,\nhe recommended that the two Code sections not be mixed up. Mr. Randolph said\nhe would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a violation of\n10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the Staff's\nrecommendation. He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained separately\nafter Dr. Lynn\u2019s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an opportunity\nto do so.\n\nVivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave. said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously\nattacked by Dr. Lynn\u2019s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in\nvet\u2019s bills.

One of the conditions of this approval was that the\nhedge along the front of the property be maintained in the condition it was in at the time the\napproval was granted. This agreement was a binding agreement, which passes on to any\nsubsequent property owner. The agreement was made January 31, 1990. The subsequent\nbuyer of this property was Mr. Trump, Trump Properties, LLC and some remodeling work\nwas done, removing the previous hedge. A new hedge was planted to replace the original\nhedge and that one has now been removed. This is a violation of the agreement. A letter was\nreceived from Mr. Royce, representing Mr. Trump, asking for a postponement of today\u2019s\nhearing. The Town does not feel this matter should be postponed.\n\nMr. Randolph summarized the letter from Mr. Royce which indicated the ficus\nhedge keeps dying and they want to replace it with something different. They plan on hiring a\nlandscape architect to go before the next Architectural Commission meeting to get approval to\ninstall a hedge in an attempt to meet the conditions of the declaration of use agreement. Mr.\nRandolph said he had discussions with Mr. Royce and Mr. Walton and Mr. Royce was told the\nTown could not recommend a postponement and the recommendation would be that they are\nfound in violation, assessed the $150.00 in administrative costs and be given until June 18th,\nwhich is the day before the June Code Enforcement Board meeting, to comply. This would\ngive them the opportunity to appear before the Architectural Commission to see if they can get\napproval to re-plant a hedge. The hedge has to be installed to the height which existed at the\ntime of the agreement which Mr. Randolph said he believed was twenty-two (22) feet.

Domestic violence and sexual assaults are other examples where enforcement shifts have\nbeen more limited but still significant. ?7\u00b0\n\nResponses by local agencies to this type of pressure have taken three basic forms. First, chief prosecutors adopted internal\noffice policies that mandate - or set a strong presumption for - [*909] prosecution of specific crimes when evidence is\nsufficient. 72! Second, prosecutors get specialized training on how to address the particular challenges posed by specific kinds\nof cases such as domestic violence or sexual assault. 7?\u201d Finally, many offices have established dedicated, in-house units of\nprosecutors who specialize in these same kinds of crimes. 27+ States legislatures have encouraged these reforms, 774 but\nvirtually everywhere, the adoption, content, and enforcement of policies is left to local chief prosecutors. No legislation sets\nspecific charging criteria, authorized judicial review, or gives enforceable rights to victims. 77>\n\nThese responses to underenforcement are meaningful, but their form is more political than legal. They are the kinds of\nresponses produced by a system of electorally accountable prosecutors and legislatures. 77\u00b0 Often they are in large part\nattributable to successful political efforts by advocacy groups. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example,\nsuccessfully urged reforms of laws and enforcement practices against intoxicated driving. 777 Feminist groups and women's\nadvocates play important, ongoing roles in reforming police and prosecution policies, substantive criminal laws, and evidence\nrules for domestic [*910] violence and sexual assault offenses. 77\u00b0 These efforts have succeeded in changing attitudes,\nprofessional cultures, and enforcement practices in police and prosecution agencies that had contributed to underenforcement in\nthese areas. 2?

L. Rev. 844, *910\n\nSuccesses notwithstanding, reliance on this kind of political supervision cannot be an equally effective remedy for\nunderenforcement across all contexts. The independence of local prosecution and police agencies means that policies,\nresources, and constituent support for rigorous enforcement inevitably vary. 7! They will differ not only across localities but\nalso according to the type of offense and the identity of the victim. Some groups, such as victims of intoxicated drivers, can\nsucceed at achieving more rigorous enforcement policies. 732 Other victims with less political support or popular sympathy -\nundocumented immigrants, sex workers, prison inmates, and casualties of police shootings 777 - have dimmer prospects when\nprosecutors are responsive to local majorities\u2019 preferences. In some places, public [*911] sentiment is a force in favor of\ncharging in categories of wrongdoing that have suffered from patterns of underenforcement. In other places, the same can be a\nforce against charging and can reinforce underenforcement practices. Either way, electoral accountability can lead to undue\npressure on prosecutors to yield to majoritarian or interest-group pressure to avoid \"commiting political suicide.\" 774\n\nIn short, political supervision, as an institutional structure to minimize unjustified failures to prosecute, is an institutional\nstructure with a highly uneven track record and decidedly mixed prospects. On the other hand, some of the strategies for\nenforcement redundancy examined above that take the form of legal entitlements would likely also achieve partial success.\nPrivate prosecution is an unpromising device to aid certain marginalized victim groups such as mmates, undocumented\nimmigrants, or low-income people generally. Other options - review of declination by courts, or concurrent jurisdiction of a\nseparate prosecution agency - hold somewhat more promise. Judicial review is somewhat more removed from political\ninfluence (though perhaps less so in jurisdictions that elect judges), 73\u00b0 although that mechanism still depends on victims to\npetition for review. The overlap of federal and state criminal jurisdiction subjects enforcement to review by a rival agency\nsubject to, at worst, different political influences. At best, as with a Justice Department that can minimize political influence\n\nwith professional and bureaucratic norms, it expands the prospect for less political review. 7\u00b0\u00b0\n\n(criticizing the use of federal convictions data in public corruption analysis and advocating instead for the use of administrative data).

Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented\ncases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.\n\nMr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this\nprocedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr.\nRandolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.\nOriginally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation\nbut ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which\nwas appealed to Town Council. Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time,\nDr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation\nwas issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to\ndetermine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time,\nwhether a fine should be imposed.

We compared the rise to fame of the\nmost famous people of different eras. We took all 740,000\npeople with entries in Wikipedia, removed cases where\nseveral famous individuals share a name, and sorted the rest\nby birthdate and frequency (23). For every year from 1800-\n1950, we constructed a cohort consisting of the fifty most\nfamous people born in that year. For example, the 1882\ncohort includes \u201cVirginia Woolf\u201d and \u201cFelix Frankfurter\u201d; the\n1946 cohort includes \u201cBill Clinton\u201d and \u201cSteven Spielberg.\u201d\nWe plotted the median frequency for the names in each\ncohort over time (Fig. 3D-E). The resulting trajectories were\nall similar. Each cohort had a pre-celebrity period ( median\nfrequency <10\u00b0), followed by a rapid rise to prominence, a\npeak, and a slow decline. We therefore characterized each\ncohort using four parameters: (i) the age of initial celebrity;\n(ii) the doubling time of the mitial rise; (111) the age of peak\ncelebrity; (iv) the half-life of the decline (Fig. 3E). The age of\npeak celebrity has been consistent over time: about 75 years\nafter birth. But the other parameters have been changing.\nFame comes sooner and rises faster: between the early 19th\ncentury and the mid-20th century, the age of mitial celebrity\ndeclined from 43 to 29 years, and the doubling time fell from\n8.1 to 3.3 years. As a result, the most famous people alive\ntoday are more famous \u2014 in books \u2014 than their predecessors.\nYet this fame is increasingly short-lived: the post-peak half-\nlife dropped from 120 to 71 years during the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nWe repeated this analysis with all 42,358 people in the\ndatabases of Encyclopaedia Britannica (24), which reflect a\nprocess of expert curation that began in 1768. The results\nwere similar (7). Thus, people are getting more famous than\never before, but are being forgotten more rapidly than ever.\n\nOccupational choices affect the rise to fame. We focused\non the 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and\n1920 in seven occupations (actors, artists, writers, politicians,\nbiologists, physicists, and mathematicians), examining how\ntheir fame grew as a function of age (Fig. 3F).\n\nActors tend to become famous earliest, at around 30. But\nthe fame of the actors we studied \u2014 whose ascent preceded the\nspread of television \u2014 rises slowly thereafter. (Their fame\npeaked at a frequency of 2x10.) The writers became famous\nabout a decade after the actors, but rose for longer and to a\nmuch higher peak (8x10). Politicians did not become\nfamous until their 50s, when, upon being elected President of\nthe United States (in 11 of 25 cases; 9 more were heads of\nother states) they rapidly rose to become the most famous of\nthe groups (1x10\u00b0).\n\nScience is a poor route to fame. Physicists and biologists\neventually reached a similar level of fame as actors (1x10),\nbut it took them far longer. Alas, even at their peak,\nmathematicians tend not to be appreciated by the public\n(2x10%).\n\nDetecting Censorship and Suppression\n\nSuppression \u2014 of a person, or an idea \u2014 leaves quantifiable\nfingerprints (25). For instance, Nazi censorship of the Jewish\nartist Mare Chagall is evident by comparing the frequency of\n\u201cMare Chagall\u201d in English and in German books (Fig.4A). In\nboth languages, there is a rapid ascent starting in the late\n1910s (when Chagall was in his early 30s). In English, the\nascent continues. But in German, the artist\u2019s popularity\ndecreases, reaching a nadir from 1936-1944, when his full\nname appears only once. (In contrast, from 1946-1954, \u201cMare\nChagall\u201d appears nearly 100 times in the German corpus.)\nSuch examples are found i many countries, including Russia\n(e.g. Trotsky), China (Tiananmen Square) and the US (the\nHollywood Ten, blacklisted in 1947) (Fig.4B-D).\n\nWe probed the impact of censorship on a person\u2019s cultural\ninfluence in Nazi Germany. Led by such figures as the\nlibrarian Wolfgang Hermann, the Nazis created lists of\nauthors and artists whose \u201cundesirable\u201d, \u201cdegenerate\u201d work\nwas banned from libraries and museums and publicly burned\n(26-28). We plotted median usage in German for five such\nlists: artists (100 names), as well as writers of Literature\n(147), Politics (117), History (53), and Philosophy (35) (Fig\n4E). We also included a collection of Nazi party members\n[547 names, ref (7)]. The five suppressed groups exhibited a\ndecline. This decline was modest for writers of history (9%)\nand literature (27%), but pronounced in politics (60%),\nphilosophy (76%), and art (56%). The only group whose\nsignal increased during the Third Reich was the Nazi party\nmembers [a 500% increase; ref (7)].\n\nGtven such strong signals, we tested whether one could\nidentify victims of Nazi repression de novo. We computed a\n\u201csuppression index\u201d s for each person by dividing their\nfrequency from 1933 \u2014 1945 by the mean frequency in 1925-\n1933 and in 1955-1965 (Fig.4F, Inset). In English, the\ndistribution of suppression indices is tightly centered around\nunity. Fewer than 1% of individuals lie at the extremes (s<1/5\nor s>5).\n\nIn German, the distribution in much wider, and skewed\nleftward: suppression in Nazi Germany was not the\nexception, but the rule (Fig. 4F). At the far left, 9.8% of\nindividuals showed strong suppression (s<1/5). This\npopulation is highly enriched for documented victims of\nrepression, such as Pablo Picasso (s=0.12), the Bauhaus\narchitect Walter Gropius (s=0.16), and Hermann Maas\n(s<.01), an influential Protestant Minister who helped many\nJews flee (7).
